1,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,"I just bought these locally and they are the best. I will keep them for the next couple of years. Great quality and fit, perfect length and the fit is perfect. I would definitely recommend these. Perfect fit. I wore this one for my birthday and it was perfect!  I love it. I will keep it. I ordered a second one so I could use it when I got home. These are great for working out. They fit well and are very comfortable. I bought this for my mom, she loves it!  I got a size small and it fits great!  It is exactly what I was looking for and looks great!  I am very happy with this purchase and will definitely be buying another color in the future. Very comfortable, it is a little narrow, but I have to give it a shot. My daughter is very tall, and the waistband is a little tight around her waist. It is comfortable, but not for a 5'6"" girl. The fabric is thin and very soft. She loves it!I like this belt. It is very comfortable. It is a little large in the shoulders, so I don't have to worry about it being too big. I have a little big calves and it is a little big on me. I will probably order another size down. I love this bra. It fits well and is very comfortable. The color is nice. The colors are good, but the material is very thin and the cups are not as long as they are in the picture. The cups are really nice. I have a medium and I like them a lot. They are a little long.",
1,Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,"I bought the black version and it is the best. I will keep this in the car and use it when I go hunting. The only negative is the plastic part. The plastic part is just a little hard to get on and off. I wish it was stronger.The pump does not work as well as I expected.  I have had to replace it with a new one.  I just went with the old pump.  The new pump works great.This is a great tool for camping or backpacking. The mount is very secure, and it is well built. This tool is super lightweight and easy to use. The mount is not too big, and it is easy to use. I would definitely recommend this to any camping friends or family.This is an awesome product and I was very impressed with the quality of the product. I'm happy with my purchase.Works great on my Trek saddle. I have the 4 wheel version of this saddle, and the saddle is a bit of a pain to get on, but it is a great product. I wear this saddle daily, and have not had any issues with it. I would recommend this saddle for anyone.This is a very nice bike.  I was looking for something that I could ride on, but I just didn't like the size.  The fact that it had a small wheel makes it very hard to ride, which is nice for a child.  It is very lightweight, and I would definitely recommend it for a beginner bike rider.",

0,Books_5,4,"I read this book before assighning it to my children.  It was definitely a fun read, and leaves you hanging so that you HAVE to read the sequel.

Yes, it does not set up blacks in a very good light, but one must consider the time it was written.  In any regard, many of the whites were portrayed in unseemly manners as well (cutthroat, evil, stupid, cowards, etc.).  As an adult, I would believe that people are smart enough to weed out the literary license taken by this piece of fiction; and discuss the book with their children as to it's story, characters, and intent.

I hope you enjoy the story as much as I did.",

Love it when I get up at night and wander through my living room to get to the kitchen.  The tiny red and amber beads among the leaves give just enough pop of color to make it charming.

0,Books_5,3,"For the untrained Clive Barker reader, Abarat will seem like a vivid dream, an elaborate creation, a thing of wonder and beauty to be praised and revered. To the serious Clive Barker reader, it amounts to the PG-13 version of Weaveworld and imajica combined. Clive has taken to the all-ages genre and created a series that is sure to make him richer than he already is, but he's not doing anything new and that is very frustrating for the Constant Reader. Abarat is a story about Candy Quackenbush who lives in the dullsville town of Chickentown, Minnesota. She is an outcast, an exile, and she can't wait to get away. Well. as you guessed, adventure finds her and she winds up in The Abarat, a series of islands in the nether world each dedicated to a certain our of the day or night. Yawn. Very formulaic for Barker. This is Clive on cruise control. This is Clive on auto-pilot. This is Clive writing for the sake of writing, being weird for the sake of nothing better to do. Clive Barker is good at being outlandish and strange and thinking up attorcities and oddities is his modus operendi. Get a clue. This is nothing new.",
0,Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,"I have 3 sets of these gloves... two of the prevouos model with the criss cross velcro strips and one of the newer rubber strips.
I find the older model gave better support and position of the knuckes was aided from the tightening of the strips.
Are they better than handwraps? if you use cheap practice gloves, yes. Specially if your hands get sore easily.
but beware that they don't offer very strong wrist support, unless you really tighten them.
the stiching on one of them has come undone, but note that is probably from choosing a wrong size... if they are not snug enough and move around inside the gloves that maight be the case... I have two L mand an Xl the Xl has had the stichting come undone.
Not that it matters much... these suckers are for punching.  I have recently traded my cheap Everlast practice gloves for Title's Fighting brand sparring gloves. Perhaps I will go with wraps again.
but yes, they are good.
but beware after a couple of heated practices the stink on these gloves is seriously offensive... SERIOUSLY. I wash mine every two practices... although the new ones, seem to have worked on that, the material lasts 3 sessions between washing.",
0,Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,"(review by my 14 yr old son): I love how the bow can change draw strengths. This allows me to progress to the full draw weight when I get stronger. I also love the bow's design and that I came with some powerful aluminum hunting arrows. I don't hunt but I do recommend this bow for any youth interested in bow hunting. Despite all the perks there are a few things I don't like. Though the package/carry case is a great way to carry your bow, you're unable to put the bow on it if you've installed the arrow holder and must remove it before putting the bow back on (I just don't use the arrow holder at all due to this). Worst of all the arrow rest strips the arrows' fletching and broke on my second shooting trip after the 14th shot just because I shot an arrow. Now That's just stupid. I'm just glad they're easily replaced by wisker biskets

Overall this is a good bow but could do with some design flaw fixes. (He ended up returning the bow.",

0,Electronics_5,4,"The radio offers pretty solid features. I just had it installed and  pretty happy for the most part. The Bluetooth is excellent, I've had to play with the EQ because it won't sound right out the box, but once you adjust the audio settings, it's a beast. I also turned up the Bluetooth audio level and now Google Music sounds pretty awesome. I like how I an have music and Google Maps running and it lowers the music for directions.

USB - The USB gave me an ""Error 19"" but noticed my Nexus 5 goes into charging mode when I plug it into the stereo. All you have to do is drop the notification bar and change it from ""Charging"" to ""MTP"". I don't carry music so I have no need for it. I actually  wanted the USB for charging, but that's very disappointing. It charges at 80mAh - 110mAh which is poor and means my phone loses battery while plugged in and using Bluetooth. I drove for 15 mins and my battery went down like 8%. Most of my charges never drop below 500mAh, most give me over 1000mAh.

Aux - My Sirius Starmate 2 is using the auxiliary input. It sounds fantastic! I have ditched the FM transmitter and Howard Stern and the music channels come in very clear. I don't know why I waited so long to upgrade my stock radio.

This stereo is connected to my factory Rockford Fosgate and it sounds better than my Nissan RF dash unit. All in all, this radio, parts and install cost me a solid $210 or so. A bit more than I was expecting but worth the price.

Rating - I gave it a 4 only because the sufficient lack of USB charge. It's pretty useless for charging for me.",

The Wallace pieces are heavier and have 18-10 stainlesss, meaning they have 8%-10%  nickel which gives them shine and means they are less likely to rust.

0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,"I bought these on my quest to replace all my bulbs with LED. These went in a chandelier that takes 4 bulbs and left me 1 spare. The bulbs are very very white without the fixture covers of the chandelier. My chandelier has an offwhite/yellowish cover over each that is open ended. That makes the light look warm. Without that, these are cool white (I ordered the 6000K bulbs because of the covers). I had 4 of the 25 watt halogens in my chandelier drawing 100 watts total. With these bulbs, I am drawing only 3 watts each at 12 watts total. It is just as bright. The bulbs should last a lot longer and didn't cost any more than the halogens I bought at Wal-Mart. I would suggest getting warm white if not going into a fixture that warms the light...that is unless you like super white light.",

However, our cat tends to get hyper and loves to run and jump.

After learning the trick I like it very much because you can light up the pattern much quicker than the old games.  The slide game works quite well.

0,Toys_and_Games_5,4,"It's a fairly entertaining game.  It takes about 5 minutes to explain the rules, and about 30 to play.  The rules are simple and there is a little amount of hidden roles to keep people guessing.  The main mechanic of the game is chucking dice, in a very similar way to King of Tokyo.  4 stars because some character cards have more of an impact than others.  Also, we found that with 6 players, it is hard for the Sheriff/Deputy to win.  Outlaws almost always win (just because 3/6 of the players are Outlaws).

I recommend this game, but only if you don't like other games that fill this particular itch better.  I'm talking about a light game, easy rules, can hold a lot of people, hidden roles, and low downtime between turns.  There are other games that I think can fill this void better, such as One Night Ultimate Werewolf, or The Resistance, just to name a couple.  But if those games aren't for you, this game can be the filler for your group.  You will have fun playing it, but I think most people would prefer the games previously mentioned, especially if we're sticking to the hidden roles action mechanic in a game.

This is not a warm glove; it is a LINER, and a very thin, open weave liner at that.  You can see your hand through the loose weave, so you wouldn't wear these for principal cold weather protection for your hands.  They fit nicely and are comfortable with good finger length, and the biosensors work well on touch screens, although I don't understand why OR put biosensors only on the thumb and index fingers instead of on all the finger tips.  The glove is very flimsy and subject to pulls, runs, and catching on things, so I would not think them durable at all.  They also have scratchy tags sewn into the insides at the wrists, which tags are annoying and look difficult to remove.  Mine did not come with the clips shown in the photo (on Amazon) that hold the gloves together when not in use.  These gloves made me think about which fingers I use on my touchscreen, and I realized that I use more than just my thumbs and forefingers (I regularly use my middle finger) so for me this glove does not have enough biosensor tips.

0,Books_5,4,"In the 21st book (of 32) of the Miss Silver series, the author not only uses her customary settings and characters (small village, lots of people with a keen interest in gossip, a pair of young lovers whose path isn't clear) but reruns some plot devices from previous novels in the series: someone returning after a long absence who was feared dead, someone asking for Miss Silver's assistance and failing to take her excellent advice, blackmail, an invalid who has nothing wrong but a desire to be catered to. This was written very competently in 1951 when the author was about 73 and had dozens of novels to her credit, so it's an engaging and assured read. I'm not giving it 5 stars only because of the retread plot devices. It's still interesting, and the young hero, Edward, is rather more romantically mysterious than her usual sort. Another aspect that is repeated (in a different manner) from the preceding novel is that Miss Silver, an elderly retired governess, is placed in danger. The earlier books kept danger mostly off-stage, with muted details reported at second or third hand. As the series progresses, though explicit violence is toned down, more action is permitted to be seen by the reader. As is often the case, the author makes the victims deserving of their fate and does not offer any positive sides to the bad guys. This is a weakness of hers, but it is in keeping with the Victorian morals of Miss Silver, a private enquiry agent who is the epitome of moral rectitude.",

0,Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,"I Moved a few years ago and my spring-form pan left me for parts unknown. So I got another one and price was on my mind.  Hey, they all leak at this price range.  Simple to take care of, use shortening like caulking and seal the inner rim and especially where the side is connected, crimped, whatever.  This is great for regular cake batter.  Also, I use a cooking or roasting bag on the outside when making cheesecake.  Just slip in the bag and cut to size.  No muss, no fuss.  I use a razor cutter to trim along the edge.

*** Update 3/3/2016
Found a non bath cheesecake recipe and made it in this pan.  Don't have to worry about leaks.  Here it is
New York Cheesecake.
2 pounds cream cheese
3/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup sour cream
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
6 tablespoons melted butter
1/4 cup white sugar
Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
2. Mix graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and 1/4 cup sugar together. Press mixture onto the bottom of one 9 or 10 inch springform pan. Place in freezer for 10 minutes.
3. Cream 3/4 cup of the sugar and cream cheese until smooth. Beat in eggs, vanilla, and cornstarch until just mixed. Stir in sour cream and mix on medium until well blended. Remember to scrape sides during mixing. Pour into prepared crust.
4. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Turn temperature down to 210 degrees and bake for 45 minutes. Turn oven off and leave cake in oven  until cool.  About 2 to 3 hours. Do NOT open oven door from the time you put it in the oven until it is cooled.  Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.  Preferably over night.  Serve with your favorite topping.

0,Books_5,5,"Roman Polanski, born on august 18, 1933, has written a fascinating autobiography. He is a sinner and a genius, a chaotic man and a passionate, he is a machismo and a vulnerable human being, he overcame the WWII, the Polish ghettos and the Holocaust as a resilient child and he lost his wife Sharon Tate and an unborn child in 1969 by the Manson Group massacre, and on the other hand he overcame (as an adult) a special pattern of machismo-self-destruction (with 13 year old girl accusing him of sexual contact). He had lived a lousy life in Nazi-surpressed Polish ghettos and he had lived with too much pride and arrogance in Hollywood, he was arrested in the United States and nevertheless now he releases movies in Paris (presently married with French actress Emmanuelle Seigner). He is a gifted filmmaker and indeed: a writer, better than any crime-author I know; his book, published in 1984, is not a larmoyant, self-pitiful autobiography alike 1001 others - it is an absorbing story about a personality-mixture-hybrid of a Robin Hood mixed with Mac Beth, an Idi Amin mixed with a Mother Theresa, it is the story of ""Roman"" P., who started his life 1933 in Paris as ""Raymond"" P.; the first sentence of his autobiography: ""For as far back as I can remember, the line between fantasy and reality has been hopelessly blurred.""

A bunch of adults discover just how frightening the wrong kind of clown can be in this horror opus. After the girl he loves is stolen away by a thuggish gang member, a young man uses the forces of evil to bring to life Killjoy (Angel Vargas), a clown doll he owned as a child. The young man is killed before the spell can fully take effect, but Killjoy soon comes to life to wreak a horrible revenge on the people who killed his master.

Review - 2/5
When I seen how low IMDB had Killjoy rated I just had to watch it. Was it really that terrible? Well I've seen much, much worse. Yeah the characters are bad and the whole cast is virtually unknown. The camera work is amateurish and cheap. But it does have it's moments that made me laugh at times. The evil clown seems like Micheal Jackson dressed up in a costume. He has some funny one liners and would have been scarier if not for the corny script. The effects aren't the greatest but for how cheaply it was made for they do ok. This film pretty much destroyed the chance of any of the actors or director ever becoming a big name. None of them has made anything of note since. Some of them haven't even acted since. Sorry but this clown in the hood type film just didn't work. It's funny for a one time watch but that's about it. I am relectant to watch the other Killjoy films but I'm sure it can't get any worse. Oh yeah, some hot black girls show some skin at least ;).",

0,Books_5,5,"Gripping, fascinating science written in a flowing, easily digested style. To say I enjoyed this book would be an understatement. I was utterly enthralled by this book. You'll find the familiar subjects here; Ebola, HIV, etc. But you'll also find viruses you've likely never heard of, learn how biological reservoirs work (as much as they are understood at least), and the vital role of amplifiers in the lives of certain viruses. The various viruses are almost characters in and of themselves as the author delves into how, and why, they do what they do. Even the largely speculative chapter on how HIV might have gotten out of rural Africa and into the cities is fascinating.

Sturdy construction, with the lid being much more substantial than Thermos R-maid,or even Colemans own 48qt cooler.

0,Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,"As I have been replacing all of my outdated appliances, both small and large, with newer, faster, fancier models, I thought that this replacement for my 25-year old toaster would be ""the bomb"".

 Unfortunately I was to be disappointed. The ""forward-facing"" slots are convenient, and the little lever that allows you to lift your toast out when it is done are well-designed. The toaster sensitivity buttons allow for a range of settings (burnt-just warmed). There is a button for ""thawing"" but I have yet to see that it does anything other than toast the item inserted. The slots are wonderfully wide for even the largest bagel, yet accomodate regular bread well. The stay-cool to the touch outside is very nice.

 The problem? It toasts one side crispy, the other luke-warm. I find it necessary to switch slots and give it an extra few seconds (as the left slot cooks more on the right side, and the right slot cooks more on the left side).

I recommend it to anyone who is either thinking of starting a business, or who feels their business is in a bit of a rut.

It has helped me do a great deal of brainstorming about the fundamentals of my business, including challenging my own biases and preconceptions about my shop.

For this price I didn't expect them to sound great, and they don't, but they are good enough for audio books and podcasts. Turns out they are uncomfortable for me. I think they could be comfortable with velour pads instead of the synthetic leatherette material. I think the leatherette material is meant to provide sound isolation, but in fact these headphones offer no appreciable sound isolation.

The biggest problem is the severe cord noise. I hear this noise even with small head movements. Heretofore, I had heard this kind of noise only with earphones (in-ear monitors), never with headphones. It's strange that only one other reviewer has complained about the cord noise with these headphones.

I might add that these headphones are larger than they look in the photo. They are large enough that I'd almost call them clunky. They are much larger than the better-sounding Sennheiser PX100, which are my favorites in lightweight portable supra-aural headphones.

0,Pet_Supplies_5,2,"Remember when Coca-Cola stupidly decided to mess with its formula and gave us ""New Coke,"" the soda no one in America had asked for? Well, the decision by Royal Canin to reformulate Indoor Light 40 gives me feelings of deja vu--why couldn't they just leave well enough alone? Whether that decision was driven by corporate bean counters looking to cut costs--as some here have suggested--I can't say. But the results, at least for my cat, have not been good.

My cat will eat ONLY dry food and, until a few weeks ago, the only brand I've ever fed him is Royal Canin, as recommended by his breeder. As time passed and he put on some weight, I moved to the Indoor Light 40 formula, which was fine... until Royal Canin decided to mess with the formula. His allergic reactions started almost immediately, though it took some consulting with my vet--and reading about similar experiences posted here--before I realized that the changed formula of his food was the cause.

I have now switched to Orijen dry cat food, which has vastly superior, high-protein meats and fish, and only 17% carbohydrates. He loves it, the allergy issues are gone and I feel better feeding him dry food that isn't laden with carbs. When it comes to cats, I can't say if my experience will be your experience. However, there seems to be no benefit to the reformulation of Indoor Light, but it has caused problems for many cat owners, including myself.

Quite similar to the famous master of manga, Osmau Tezuka's  ""Knight of Ribbons"" where a young princess dresses up in a male  garb to embark on a soul-searching odyssey, Utena with her cotton  candy-pink hair and sparkling blue eyes dons a boy's school uniform and  dates the other girls at a very swanky academy school where young children  of the mythical land attend. Then Utena meets a very mysterious black girl  with startling green eyes and lavendar curls at a rose-choked greenhouse  where she tends to the colorful flowers. And Utena sees her get slapped  around. So she challenges the tormenter to a duel, which would take place  in the great ivory arena up in the heavens right underneath a floating  inverted castle. And wins. Thus the ""Rose Bride"" quite gratefully  throws herself at Utena's feet - much to her unwillingness to claim her. A  very misty-eyed fantasy tale filled with princely (princessly?) heroism,  chivalric romance, theatrical drama, lots of swashbuckling action, ideal  visions of innocent childhood and adolescent rebellion, and lesbian  suggestions.

I contemplated getting a generic brand but after thinking it through and ordering and comparing the Neato replacement filter with this brand I decided to go with the brand. I found that the material used to make the pleats of the filter were of higher quality than the original filter however a note to this is that filters on these units will get irreversibly clogged up with dirt and you will be better off replacing the filter after about 20-30 cleanings depending on the composition of dirt on the floors. That said the filters are consumable items and being able to purchase these filters at a lower (approx. 1/2) price meant that I could have more of them.

Sure the fabric is a little thicker, but it wicks sweat well and is certainly useable when it is a little warmer out--while still protecting your arms from the sun.  For warmer weather though, I recommend the long sleeve Attack jersey (especially the newer version).  Still the Quest represents a good value.  Fitment is perfect for me.  6'0"", 185lb and Large size fits perfect.  I wish the zipper went all the say down but it still is a great jersey.",
0,Books_5,5,"I read this book as a teen-ager and was constantly putting it down because it was making me so nervous. I saw even then, at a young age, how possible it was for this world to become a reality. How many people try to lose themselves in drugs, alcohol, meaningless TV? We are closer to this Brave New World than we like to admit. Can this insanity our world is headed toward be stopped? I don't know but I fear that Huxley understood the human conditon all too well. We believe everything we hear on TV or read in the newspapers. Too many of us have left our intelligence and perception at the door. Wake up before it is too late and think for yourself. There was a version of Brave New World with Leonard Nimoy which presented a sort of happy ending for two people, which did not occur in the book but still leaves the Brave New World untouched. I won't say too much about John ""the Savage"" who was more human than the rest of the population but he is the mirror Huxley uses to show us how barren and sterile this Brave New World is. A place where every word can be uttered except mother and father. Children are born in laboratories. The family unit has been disassembled with all loyalty going to the state. As frightening as it is, it a must read for those who want to understand what is happening now and how easily it can happen. The question becomes: do we rule technology or do we allow it to rule us?",
0,Electronics_5,5,"I am so impressed with this Micro SD Adaptor.  Not only it fits in my Dell XPS15, 9560, but it is very well made.  It is much more expansive than other micro SD adapters.  The card is little bit shorter (about 0.5mm) than the depth of the SD card slot (see attached photo) because it is not made for the XPS15, 9560, but it is not a problem.  There is no problem removing it from the laptop with you finger nail.  The manufacturer is not planning to make a custom fitting card adapter for the new Dell XPS15, 956-0, so you have to settle for this adapter if you are looking for flush fitting Micro SD Adapter.  When buying this adapter, make sure to get the right model (103A).  The other models made by BaseQi are either too short or too long or do not fit at all.
Prior to buying this, I bought a very inexpensive plastic adapter, and it destroyed the SD card slot's internal card contacts on the first try.  I had to replace the laptop motherboard to correct the damaged card slot.  Yes, the card reader slot is embedded on the motherboard, so there was no other solution but replacing the entire motherboard.  Yes, it was an over $1,000.00 mistake.  You get what you pay for.

This could be credited to extreme sloppiness and mistakes that editors should notice right away. Like the fact that California is 9, not 8 hours behind Amsterdam. Consecutive chapter headings of Wednesday the 10th and Thursday the 12th (with a mention of Friday the 13th) make me wonder what happened to the 11th day of that month. Mr Baker is referred to as ""Mrs"" Baker. (What the hell do editors do these days?) And there are probably others that my quick reading or fading memory have missed.
If  you have a craving for some Chet Baker (who doesn't/shouldn't?) I would suggest de Valk's bio, or pre-order Gavin's. If you have mystery fix, just buy Elmore Leonard. I am not familiar with the other works of Mr Moody, I like the idea of jazz mysteries but heavily shy away from silly clichs and most of all bad writing.

It's written more like a detailed account of someones life. Like watching a real life family live and writing each conversation and event in detail.

0,Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,"REVIEW OF:  TCP RLP381430WL 14W LED PAR38 40 DEGREE WET LOCATION RATED SPOT LIGHT BULB, WARM WHITE

This efficient bulb casts a nice bright light-Brightens the entire front of the house for added safety. This Light bulb's standard-sized base screwed in immediately to existing socket.

This indoor/outdoor LED light bulb exceeded expecations. Over the years energy saving bulbs have gotten better, but many still seem kind of dull and gloomy. Oftentimes, the bluish light just hurts your eyes.  How often have you consoled yourself with the thought that by compromising a nice light you are saving energy and money?  No longer.

This bulb is doing a great job of providing the outdoor porch with a nice warm, yet bright light. No creepy shadows where miscreants can hide!

A heavy bulb, it measures 5.2"" x 5.8"" x 5.9"".  It is rated to use 14 watts of energy, and at 1050 lumens it is theoretically equivalent to a incandescent 90 watt  bulb. This light bulb is fixed at that wattage and does not dim. One can expect this bulb to last about 25,000
hours.  Roughly that's about 5.7 years, assuming 12 hours of darkness a night (25,000/12/365=5.7 years.). Well, that'd be great and at $19.80 /bulb would give you outdoor weatherproof light for less than $3.50 a year.

The bulb should work well in most areas as it is rated to function at  temperatures ranging from  -4 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

Security is increased with brightly lit areas....................

I'd like to thank Amazon for the opportunity to review this indoor/outdoor LED light bulb that I received as a complimentary sample in exchange for this honest review.

I ordered them for my daughter, my husband and I are trying to get pregnant and I have gotten quite excited and have already bought a fair amount of wardrobe items. I ordered these pearls thinking they would be excellent for the baby photos however, this set is more appropriate once she is a teenager.

I must admit, when I saw the High quality and great size of these pearls along with the excellent knotting between each individual pearl, I immediately put it around my own neck and looked in the mirror. I think these make excellent casual pearls for a small framed woman!  These are a fantastic value. In my photos I have this necklace along with my own pearl necklace which was around 1k I believe but that was so many years ago, I don't remember. I think the size of these pearls is FANTASTIC, the shapes of the individuals don't have the consistency and perfect shape as my older pearls have but this is because these are cultured pearls.

0,Pet_Supplies_5,1,"While I like the idea of my dogs having better breath, this stuff isn't the solution. Pro-Sense has some good products - I'm using their hip and joint supplement for my 14 year old dogs with real success. However, this water additive is a failure here.

None of my dogs will drink the water with even a teaspoon of this added. I keep three huge water bowls through out the house at all times - 6 dogs tend to empty them all at least once a day and twice a day if it's hot. I did two bowls with this added and one plain water. Not one dog would touch the water with the rinse in it. All six went to the untainted water bowl - I had to refill it three times yesterday. This morning I just emptied and scrubbed the other two and refilled with plain water.np Two dogs went right to them.

My other issue here is the inclusion of sorbitol in the ingredients. Why on Earth does dog mouth wash need a chemical fake sweetener?? I won't eat or drink anything with that nasty stuff in it and I don't want my dogs having it either. Between the sorbitol and all 6 dogs avoiding this, it's not something I would ever recommend.",

The scale plate is stainless steel. The scale has 4 buttons to operate and a LCD screen display with a blue back light which makes it nice and easy to read your results.  It has many functions.. such as power, tar, mode and pcs. Thankfully I had my son here and he helped go through some of it with me faster. It is pretty easy to use once you begin to use. You can weigh 0.1 gram to 2000 grams.. It has different units depending on different countries :g/oz/ozt/dwt/ct/gn,  you can choose your frequently-used unit. Another great thing is it has a 60 sec Auto Shut off, which is great if you forget to shut it off your not wasting your batteries.

0,Movies_and_TV_5,1,"I was super-excited about the original films being released on Blu-ray......until the news arrived that Lucas was further altering them by adding new dialogue.

While the whole ""NOOOO!"" sequence has been much-ballyhooed by viewers, it did somewhat fit in 'Sith.'  For 'Jedi'.....absolutely not.  The original scene, where Vader quietly watches Palpatine attempt to murder Luke and then has a change of heart, is so much more powerful in that Vader makes his decision in complete SILENCE.  Considering that Anakin is depicted as a hotshot motormouth in the prequels, it makes the silence of the original cut of 'Jedi' so much more powerful.  (And, while I'm at it on 'Jedi', why did Lucas have to change the music at the end?  Totally ruined my childhood memories of watching my battered old VHS.)

Look, Mr. Lucas, as a writer/editor both in career and hobby, I can understand about creating something wonderful and then always wondering how it could have been made better.  Seriously, though.  Please stop.  You created an amazing fictional world that became bigger than anyone could have ever dreamed of.  It is a cultural phenomenon that has forever changed film and the lives of fans.  Why ruin a good thing?

0,Movies_and_TV_5,4,"I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it in theater.  Its Andrew Dice Clay's first feature film and it delivers the typical Dice-persona antics.  Yes he had many misogynistic jokes at the time, but I separate this movie from his comedy; I mean, he takes care of a koala bear in the movie, how mean could he be?

The movie is about his character Ford Fairlane, a rockabilly style detective who works on cases for rock stars.  The only problem is most of his clients pay him in things other than money, such as guitars, sex, etc...

He comes across a case that involves finding 3 different cds or something like that.  I mean, they actually tried to put a plot in this movie, but you could have had a movie alone with just the main characters antics.  In a classic scene, Ford wakes up with two women in his bed and as the women start to leave he pleasingly begs them, ""hey girls, make breakfast, do my laundry""; classic stuff.

Eventually, Wayne Newton shows up as the bad guy and we are treated to scenes of Ford Fairlane making witty remarks towards Wayne Newton's character(Julien Grendel).

As many other reviewers have already somewhat detailed the storyline, suffice it to say it relates the adventures of a scholar and the captain of the guard of a member in the government of Caliph Haroun al-Rashid as they go in search of a powerful magical tablet.  Being chased by an evil spy and a Magi, they encounter a lost city in the desert, a djinn, a desert of actual souls (hence, the title), and other beings and objects, natural and magical.

It's written in the style of the Arabian Nights but with an emphasis on the action-adventure of a sword-and-sorcery tale.  The author also conjures up new magical creations and beings not found in the typical Arabian Nights tale.

Pros - Beautiful landscapes.
  Amazing outdoor shots and colors
  Easy to carry. Good response time. Good video too.
I have made a few trips, shot photos/videos at a couple of marriages and the comments on my landscape shots have generally been 'which camera do you have? Wooh that's costly for a non-SLR camera but the landscape shots are surely good.'

Cons- Indoor shots suck big time, flash power is too weak. I used a extra flash which had multiple levels but the light level indoors would either come too bright or weak and it would be just right only a few times.

I had bought it for around 600+ dollars(including the cost of accessories) when it had come out and was impressed by its build quality. It really looks cool and compact. But it turns out the prices of compactness is paid in the life of the camera. Since the lens retracts back and out it has a good chance of getting damaged. It looks like some sensors(battery/door/lens sensors) have got damaged.

That moving part stopped working a few weeks back. It does not start up and the repair cost will be at least half the cost of a good new camera. I have film cameras bought buy my dad's uncle at a yard sale in the 1950s that still work fine. I was expecting this camera to last me for at least 10 years.

I removed the dress from the package and was happy that I did not smell anything weird. I worry with less expensive items that they smell like chemical. This is not the case with this dress.

The dress is an excellent fit. I cannot believe how good of a fit. I normally wear a 12 (US) and I ordered the XL. I also was happy that I can wear my normal bras with this dress and the straps do not show, seriously, look at the pictures. The bra is not visible!

The story seems formulaic, safe - the sad stories of several women who meet at a knitting circle. The sadness is brought out pretty well, especially initially about the main character Mary's loss. But too much of sadness going on and on works against the story, I feel, so I began to ignore the emotional meanings and look for the story.

I tried to keep at it, but I gave up halfway, which is rare for me to do. I actually skipped the stories of two of the women - you know they are coming, and you don't care about any of them so why should you be forced to read what sad things they went through? Disappointing book.",

I notified Amazon and they sent out a replacement drive right away. One thing about RAID5 arrays...making changes takes forever. It took a 2 days to initialize my array and 4 days to rebuild it after replacing the failed drive. A week later the RAID management software came up with an error indicating that the replacement drive could not be found. Turns out the SATA connector had come loose. I immediately ordered new SATA cables with the metal clips on the end that lock the connector in place. Overall I'm very happy with these drives.

The pilot is one of my go-to boots. I wear the hell out of them and buy a new pair every other year depending on what I put them through. I wear them for dress, for work, for hiking, for fishing. They hold up very well, always look good, and are always comfortable.

The biggest reason I wear them is that I can trust the size. I wear a 13 EE and over the years the fit has always been true. That's a huge relief since buying a good, wide, boot or show is a serious PITA.

The boots are not without their short comings but these are, relative to the price, minor things. The shoe-lace metalic tabs get lose eventually and bend and require a pair of pliers to bend back and keep in place. But, like I said, this is a minor thing.

It's true, they are better than nothing, but they offer no protection against water and very little protection against wind, and are only meagerly insulated; I would feel my hands getting extremely cold after only a few minutes in 35-45 degree weather. I would also call durability into question because the fabric they are made from has started pilling after only a few weeks of use and the strap holding the retaining clasp on one of the gloves snapped right off while pulling them out of my back pocket. Again, these gloves are certainly better than nothing, but are near useless if used around water, snow, or ice, and are certainly not useful for use around freezing temperatures. These are almost certainly more suitable for use a a liner for a heavier glove or mitten than as a standalone unit and I would recommend using it as such.",

0,Pet_Supplies_5,4,"I was contacted by this vendor to provide a review in exchange for a discounted price.  That said,  I'm glad I purchased this toy.  My male cat especially goes crazy over it.  My female cat hasn't bothered with it as much but hasn't been feeling well in general.

Height/Size is good and rope is wound and secured tight to post.  Base is solid and stands tall when cats scratch.  As my pictures show, my male cat has long legs and body and this post height fits him fine. Assembly is easy, only requiring a philips screwdriver.  My young niece and nephew had fun assembling it for the cats who started using it immediately.  The feather is a nice tease and so far still in tact after a few days of use. My cats seem to like the course texture.  From the pictures you'll see the cat playing with it in different rooms as we moved around looking for the right spot. Placing it where he stalks helps keeps him from scratching the carpets and furniture. My cats do well when we stimulate them with toys preventing boredom. The quarter circle shape fits nicely in corners or along walls.  We already had a post  with a square base and spring with pom-pom, which I don't like as much as this post.  I've never seen my cat go for the Pom-pom but the feather gets them going!  Having more in the house is not a problem, one upstairs, one downstairs.

Two items I would like to see the vendor improve would be including felt pads underneath so it doesn't scratch my wood laminate floor (I will add some felt furniture pads underneath).  Second, increasing the post diameter at least one inch. Currently it's under three inches and a little narrow.",

So I started putting some peanut butter in it, it keeps him entertained for a few minutes. He's not a very playful dog, he won't taste the ball he won't play with toys. So this gets him to be a little bit more active, which we love.

In frustration, I came back to the cassette adapter concept. Thanks to a previous reviewer who mentioned that this adapter works with GM factory cassette decks and others won't. I purchased this adapter and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Griffin-9749-PJBLK-PowerJolt-Auto-Charger-for-iPod-Black/dp/B000FIQC5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Griffin 9749-PJBLK PowerJolt Auto Charger for iPod (Black)</a>&nbsp;and it's a near-perfect solution for me. There's one more wire to deal with, but the sound quality (no static, no auto shutoff) is worth it.

Update 3/28/09: After about a year and a half of occasional usage, the tape deck stopped liking the adapter. It would try to change sides a couple of times and then eject the adapter. Maybe something wore out? I purchased a replacement unit and it works fine, so it wasn't the deck. Someday I'll own a car with an iPod port...

Update 12/8/09: The second one stopped working last month--that is to say, the tape deck started rejecting it. Eight months of very occasional use? I would really like to know what part is wearing down and causing this. I purchased another new one and we'll see how long that one lasts. If this one doesn't work out, maybe I'll just go buy a handful of cheap ones at the 99 Cents Only store.

Update 1/24/10: The third one stopped working, but I don't think it's the adapter; I think it's my cassette deck. So I can't really blame the adapter.

0,Movies_and_TV_5,1,"I agree with many of all these less-than-impressed reviews of this movie.  I am really getting tired of how todays films depend so much on CGI.  It's just not perfected yet.  It still looks way too cartoonish which is very hard to take seriously.  I miss the sci-fi horror films of the 1980's.  Creating special effects WITHOUT CGI looked more realistic on film back then.

And what's more.  I have yet to see any Will Smith film worth watching twice.  He does ""big budget"" films, but they are generally all pretty lame in appeal.  His ""Wild Wild West"", ""Independence Day"", ""Men in Black"", ""I Robot"", etc.  These are just a few of some pretty lame big box office Hollywood films.

""Hitch"" didn't have any CGI, so I guess what made that film bad was just Will Smith himself.  Well, wait a minute.  It's not that I don't like Will Smith.  I just don't like any of his films.  Any actor could have replaced him in all those films of his, and it will still be an overblown, but still dull movie to me.  I guess I just don't care for his choices in his movie career.

Homosexuality, dead dog in the trunk, marijuana/alcohol abuse: such subject matter makes WB decidedly NOT a family or date movie. Not one you would watch with your mom. Wonderboys is best watched with open-minded friends or alone at night after a weird day. Masterful performances by Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, and Robert Downey, Jr.

 Michael Douglas is a college writing professor at a small school in Pennsylvania. He is having an affair with the chancellor's wife, and his second novel is either stalled or out of control. Enter James, his oddball class prodigy. Played by Maguire, James' pale face and helpless demeanor leads Douglas to take him under his wing. But instead of providing fatherly guidance, Douglas and his editor pal Robert Downey Jr. lead James on lots of frat-boy hijinks.

Although Saba is very close with her brother, she does not care for her younger sister, Emmi.  She views Emmi as a weak, distracting child, who only gets in the way.  Once Lugh is kidnapped, Saba begins her quest to recover her brother and  quickly learns that she is a fighter who will do anything to protect her family.

0,Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,"I got this item on Thanksgiving/Black Friday this year with a sale they were having, so for the sale price of $64 it was a great deal.  I had gone back and forth for a while about whether I was going to switch to this type of coffee maker from my traditional 4 cup coffee pot I had used for years, mainly due to the expense and the taste of some of the pods.  I ordered the filter/pod assembly where you can use your own coffee grinds as well (figured that would save on expense). One thing I did decide to do (which I am glad about) is to get this model because it has the water reservoir that holds quite a bit of extra water.  I am really happy about that.  The coffee maker came quickly and I have used it now for about a month.  It took some trial and error with the grinds and the type to use in the filter but I finally have that down pretty good.  I ended up looking for my favorite brand of pods as well that were on sale, so most of the time I use the filter and my own coffee, but then every few cups I go with a pod.  That saves some money too.  I do think this whole style of coffee maker uses way more coffee than the normal brewer, however that being said - the convenience of the one cup and how hot it comes out, I actually don't think I would ever go back to the traditional pot, and that is saying a lot - because like I said I fought this switch for a while.  All in all I am extremely happy with this product and am glad I bought it and switched over.",

0,Books_5,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Double Fudge"". . . This book once again focuses on the book's main character Farley Drexel Hatcher (B.K.A. ""Fudge""). He is absolutely hilarious in this book. His obsession with money, his twin cousins and their little brother nicknamed ""Mini"", along with their parents are another interesting twist in this story. Peter Hatcher, Fudge's  older brother, who is now an official ""junior high school student"",  typically experiences all of the anxiety that is associated with  early adolesence.
This book made me laugh and laugh, especially the reaction of Mr. Hatcher when he discovers that their his cousins  want to stay at their house longer than a week.
I was also able to put myself in  many of the situations and generally grasp a feel each of the characters.
The first book that I ever read in the Fudge series was ""Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing"" followed by ""Superfudge"". I can remember attending Jefferson Elementary School in Little Rock, Arkansas waiting in line for what seemed like an infinity, to have first bid on checking out that book. I became a ""reader beaver"" thanks to Judy Blume and the wonderful staff at Jefferson Elementary who encouraged all students to build their foundation through reading. I used to walk swifly through the library with the rest of my classmates running straight towards the ""B"" fiction section --shouting, ""Ready or not here I come.""
This is an excellent read, and it is authors like Judy Blume who grasp the interest of young readers by  making her work interesting and identifiable to young readers. Thank you Ms. Judy Blume for providing great reading material for children of all ages!",

After about a year of use with the bulb I decided to give it a try. It is so bright that I am not using it in the dark, so it is not that bright.

It is bright enough to see in a dark room, but not so bright that it causes vision problems. It is very easy to adjust the brightness of the light. The light is very bright, which is why I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a dimmed light. I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a bright light.

Growing up, we always had the huge R2D2-style contraptions posted up in our hallway during the winter months - given that it was in a house made sense but it was always a pain to refill. This is simple and convenient to just have on your nightstand or side table; the power cord being so long is a plus too. Once it's plugged in and you hit the power button, a nice, steady mist comes out.

Unfortunatly, like most games, once you play a long time and master the skills asked...there is little left to do.  The biggest drawback on this one is there is a store you can go to, to buy items for your dog after you earn coins throughout the game...well, my daughter went and bought out all the items as soon as she had the money to do so...then kept going back to the store and realized, they don't restock. So then she stocked up on like 50 bottles of shampoo, water, and dog food :)  Cute, but then she got really frustrated that the screen was really useless at that point and really never needs to go there again.

0,Kindle_Store_5,5,"I first read Ernest Hemingway as a young college student and missed the depth in his simplicity. Reading him again has turned my opinion around. I urge you to read this book. In ""The Old Man and the Sea,"" he shows the story is not in the language per se, but in the complexity found in the subtle reality of life. Of course, ""Old Man,"" is not subtle in the classic sense. What I mean is that Hemingway doesn't labor the book with fantastic descriptions detailing the intricacies of the sea, or of being a fisherman. Instead, he delves into the mind of the old man, shows the fatherly love he has for a young boy, and the quest for his legacy. A quick read, I finished it in three or so hours. I was captured by the smell of the salt and the slippery feel of fish squirming in a net. I felt the thirst of a long night fighting a huge fish, and the burn of a fishing line running through my hands. I missed the young boy's company late on the boat, and also wished he were to help me fish. How Hemingway did do this to me?

As a Midwesterner, I have barely seen the sea, and have never really fished. It is a great book. Read it for the drama, the language, the psychology, the suspense. It is romance in the sense an old western novel is a romance. By all means, read it. I fully recommend ""The Old Man and the Sea"" by Ernest Hemingway. Anthony Trendl

0,Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,"So, I purchased this net for a different use than most of you likely will.  I go canoeing a lot, and it's not feasible to haul an anchor around when portaging along with all of my other gear (fishing gear, food, beverages, etc).  Instead, I used some plastic zip ties to tie one end of the net together to form a mesh bag of sorts, and I put rocks in the net to use it as an anchor along with some light rope while I'm fishing.

I specifically purchased this net because some of the reviews said that it was a nice heavy and durable material, and they weren't wrong.  Since my net drags on the bottom of lakes full of 15+ pounds of rocks while I'm fishing, it needs to be durable and this one has delivered thus far.  At $5, the price was right too.

0,Electronics_5,4,"UPDATE #2: As promised, the vendor sent a replacement headset, which does seem to work better. I was also surprised to find this one fits better too as I did NOT expect that. The original headset seems to be too springy (not really a great way to describe it, but the best words I can come up with at the moment), so it is constantly pulling at my ears and coming loose even with slight movement. This one seems to a little loser, so it is more forgiving of head movement. SO, headset #2 seems to have addressed my two biggest complaints about the headset, so I am happy to upgrade the rating to 4 stars instead of the original 1 star rate. Kudos to Patozon for taking the time to make things right!

UPDATE: The vendor has reached out to me after this review and they are sending me a replacement headset which I think is awesome. I have bumped this up to a two stat based on the customer service. Once I get the headset, assuming there is improvement in their performance, maybe I can bump it up even higher.

I am surprised this headset is so highly rated. I find them to not fit very well and they are constantly falling out of my ears even with the proper ear piece size. That alone would not justify the 1 star rating, but combined with the low sound quality and awful Bluetooth connection, this headset is a huge disappointment. Using a Samsung Galaxy S6, any audio streamed to this device is choppy, in many cases beyond comprehension, unless the phone is about 2 inches from the heaset; even then, sometimes it still doesn't work. I do not have this same issue with other Bluetooth devices paired to this phone. Given the primary function of a headset is to play audio and the fact that this headset doesn't seem to be able to do so warrants a 1 star rating. Wish I knew why some many others have a different experience with this product.",

You can rest it directly on the floor or mount it on the wall. I opted for a wall mount and found the included mounting diagram to be helpful in drilling the included brackets. I actually mounted mine sideways and it feels rock solid on the wall. The buttons feel a little tight, and I question their longevity with repeat use, however, they seem to be of nice quality so it should be fine. There's a filter on the back that can be removed for cleaning, but I can tell already it'll be a pain to get to, given the unit is mounted to the wall.

In this alternated world in 1985 in Britain, time travel is routine, cloning is a reality (dodos have been resurrected,) and literature is taken very seriously. People can get lost in poems and stories, and first editions are forged. This is all usual for Thursday Next, a literary detective. But then someone begins kidnapping characters from stories. And when Jane Eyre is kidnapped, Thursday has to track down the villain and go into the novel herself. This is a really great book; playful and wonderful. I loved the world-building in the book, though there were a lot of specialized terms that you had to learn to make sense of the story. Also, I really liked the character of the villain, Acheron Hades. He was so deliciously evil. And seemingly invincible. Fforde's writing style was really great too; you know, that British style. It was straightforward but also had dry humor. And action, but not too much action. Fforde is actually from Wales, I think. This is the first book in the Thursday Next series, which includes Lost in a Good Book, The Well of Lost Plots, and Something Rotten. *You can read all of my reviews at my book review blog, novareviews. blogspot.",

The spoke magnet was a little tricky to install but once I had it oriented the right way (directions are not crystal clear) it went off without a hitch.  The wheel sensor has a little green led that flashes when it detects the magnet so you can test the distance between magnet and sensor to make sure its correct and working.

The display comes setup for handle bar mounting but instructions are clear and simple if you need to change its orientation on the base plate for stem mounting.  The computer twists off the base plate so you can pocket it and walk away when leaving the bike locked up in a  dicey area.  The instruction book comes with a tire chart so you can set tire size without having to measure anything.

Keep in mind that the display never actually turns off; when it detects no activity for a while (15? minutes) it switches to standby mode and just shows computer model number.  Even with that the battery (CR2032) is said to last a year in both the computer and speed sensor so we will see.

There are a few things that I wish it did differently, however these are small issues and it handles the basic important functions I need (pace, avg pace, distance, heart rate .... etc.) very well.  The main display is easy to read and you can scroll up/down to get other information while you run.  The two smaller displays at the top are a bit small (I had to buy a pair of sunglasses with ""cheaters"" built in - yes, I'm over 40).

It does find the satellites very quickly when you start your run from the same place each time, however does take longer (maybe a minute or more) if you start from someplace else.  This seems to be common among gps watches however.",

0,Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,"Its a good stand for infrequent repair work. Arrived early and assembled in about 10 minutes. Looks sharp and professional and the color is a nice touch and it feels very sturdy.

However I did experience some things that I did take a star from.
1. The bolt that supports the clamp came slightly bent. Trying to figure out if its worth taking and putting it in my vise to bend back or call park tool and do the return dance. Its not a severe bend, but when under load it is clearly visible but not sagging too much

2. The clamp rotating mechanism on mine tends to stick. I am chalking this up to needing some lubrication in the top to allow some more movement.

3. The legs do not fold up into a contraption that allows them to stay. The kind of flop around. A nite-ize might solve this and clean this up, but how hard would it be to include a plastic piece to put on the stand to keep the legs together?

I honestly expected a bit more from Park Tool. If the bolt is bent from a default then I get that, but I bought this stand and spent more money since I didn't want what looked like Chinese knockoffs and the quality that I know and come to love with Park Tool. This is a great stand to use when I am cleaning my bike after a ride or doing some adjusting, but I would be weary to doing some hard core wrenching on this due to the clamp. I am just getting into MTBing so this will suit me fine, but serious and seasoned riders might want to look to a PCS-10 or another step up stand. This one will be fine for now for novice guys wanting to tinker on their bike and don't mind some of the shortcomings.",

0,Kindle_Store_5,3,"While the first Dark Screams volume was a wild mixture of stories without a recognizable common theme, this second collection seems better tuned. It presents stories of dark things lurking in completely unobtrusive places. A swimming pool, walls in a house, or even a wardrobe - suddenly they reveal a hidden evil which bereaves them of their inconspiciousness.

The Deep End (Robert McCammon)
Very straightforward and uncomplicated. My only criticism would be the unnecessary 'epilogue'. I guess this one is my favorite. 4 stars.

Interval (Norman Prentiss)
The first part really gave me the creeps because of its realistic subject. Unfortunately, the author added some supernatural element which didn't work out for me, but add confusion to an otherwise great story. 3 stars

If These Walls Could Talk (Shawntelle Madison)
Nice one with an unexpected twist that caught me by surprise and made me shudder. I loved the detail with the fox eye. 4 stars

The Night Hider (Graham Masterton)
Great reference to the author C.S. Lewis, though I would have preferred something more fantastic in the line of his work. The ending was not as climactic as expected and Jerry's sacrifice seemed unnecessary. 4 stars

Whatever (Richard Matheson)
A collection of song lyrics, interview snippets and articles, loosely connected into a story about a rockband. Dragged on and on without getting anywhere. Sorry, this was not my cup of tea. 1 star

Waking Up

by Kirsten Clare

I am a huge fan of both Hideo and Tessa. They were both so young and had everything going for them in a way that I thought was totally unexpected.

Hideo was a fourteen year old boy who had a crush on Tessa. He was also the older sister of a famous businessman who had a crush on him. He was a good guy and was very involved with the club. Tessa was a very vulnerable girl who had no idea she was in a relationship with anyone but her best friend. She was a shy girl who had a crush on him from the very beginning.

The chemistry between them was amazing. They both had their ups and downs and they both had some ups and downs that made the chemistry between them melt. The chemistry between them was unbelievable. It was not a bad book but I would have liked more of the chemistry between them.

That's the peoblem with all three films from the very beginning you know what the message is (none being at all enlightening) and then are forced to watch a long drawn out story with no twists, no insight, and does absolutely nothing to relate to the viewer or to draw you in, 2 of which are ended with a scene of violence that utimately means nothing.

The book has a lot of fun, and is very educational. I think that this book will help you to become a better person, and I would highly recommend it.This book was just ok.

0,Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,"When I saw how comfortable the model in the picture looked, I knew I had to have one. This pillow is of very high quality, is a good compromise between soft and firm (right in the middle), and is exactly as pictured.

Because it is a larger item to ship, the package was vacuum-sealed, but I had absolutely no problems getting it out and fluffing it to its full potential size. I love how the size and versatility of the pillow's opening allows you to be very flexible with your sleeping options. I am a side sleeper, so I simply adjust the other side of the pillow so that it is touching my back to create a very comfortable cocoon.

The absolute best thing about this pillow is that it stays very cool. I am in Southern California, where we occasionally see 75-80 degree weather in January, so I was very happy to find that this pillow is great at cooling and overall temperature regulation. Overall, a great purchase - this pillow has allowed me to sleep like a baby. The only bad thing about this pillow is that it is not quite as full as I would have liked it, hence my 4-star rating.

0,Movies_and_TV_5,5,"Originally released in 1934 as ""Babes in Toyland,"" this film is far and away the best of the Laurel & Hardy operettas.

Towards this end Barnaby banishes Bo-Beep's beloved Tom-Tom (Felix Knight) and attempts to take over Toyland with his demon army.  Fortunately, Stannie Dum and Ollie Dee, the assistants of the Toymaker (William Burgess), save the day with the help of the marvelous giant-sized Wooden Soldiers.  Based on the operetta by Victor Herbert (several songs are omitted), this film was directed by Gus Meins and Charles Rogers, and is much superior to the Disney version that ended up replacing it on television.  You will find less slapstick than usual in a Laurel & Hardy film, but the boys are better integrated into this musical than any of there others and Brandon's Barnaby is deliciously wicked.

0,Kindle_Store_5,4,"If you haven't read anything in the Wine of the Gods series...book 18 is not a good place to start.  I really like this universe (multiverse?), but there are so many characters and so much about the world(s) that is hinted at it becomes a bit overwhelming.  Unless you have read the whole series and have the background.

That being said, for those of you who are fans this adds a wonderful new group of magic users to the mix.  Having some new blood to add to the already defined groups should shake things up nicely.  We also see more action by mage compass's, which is a nice change from the usual witches pyramids.  Some of the first hints of a coming tech/magic revolution that may make the industrial revolution look like a minor upgrade.  A whole new pyramid also is peeking around the edges.

Now for the bad:  Much as I like this world ^and^ the writing, this is not a good short story.  This is more of a chronology of what happened.  While some of the characters learned new skills or information, we did not.  More about filling in the blanks and backstory than developing a character.

There is a teaser at the end of the book showing the next(?) in the series that gives me a lot of hope.  The Sea Kings!!  An almost unexplored area.

0,Kindle_Store_5,4,"*This Book Was Given To Me By The Author In Exchange For An Honest Review*

This book may just be the total epitome of geekyness and I don't mean that in a bad way. It is obvious that the writer is completely in love with everything to do with this genre and the book is filled with references galore that the nerd in me reveled in at first although I must confess I preferred the earlier slightly less obvious mentions to the later ones that were quite blatent and at times I found myself lost in the ""What is that reference game"" which took me momentarily away from the focus of the story,

The book itself is split into 3 mini books each a little story within themselves. Personally I loved the first book the best and I wish that the author had carried along in that vein of thought but don't get me wrong the 2nd and 3rd books are good in their own way, they just have a different feel to them.

As the books progress the author moves you from ""almost"" reality, way into the depths of fantasy and he does it well although there are moments that felt a little forced or disjointed for me which is fairly common in newer writers.

Overall I would say if like me you are a fan of Epic Fantasy and would feel right at home in the middle of a comic con convention then this would be a good fit for you.

I am very happy with them!I bought this for my wife and her husband for Christmas and they love it. They have a lot of options, but I like the fact that I can change them for different times and brands. I also like the fact that they have a little LED light that is brighter than my old incandescent bulbs. I love the fact that the light is not so bright as a incandescent bulb. I also like the fact",

I bought this switch with the idea that if I could not make it work I would ask my son for help. I have a TV with only two HDMI ports and needed to connect it to a DVD and a Roku as well as my cable modem. Guess what! By following the advice in other reviews, I have a working setup. I still don't understand what the 5v charger input is supposed to do or why the ""Select"" button doesn't select. Also, I don't need to use the remote control (I already have a handful of remotes and don't want to juggle another).

I usually wear a size 8 and ordered a medium. They are a little too big for me, but I'm sure I will get the correct size. I ordered a medium and they fit perfect.

1,Movies_and_TV_5,5,"This is a film a little more than an adaptation of a book by the same name.  It is an adaptation of a book, and it is the first film to take place in the UK.  It is in English, which is one of the most important languages in the world.  The English translation is also the most beautiful, and the ending is very moving.  I will say that the story of the film is pretty accurate.  I have a hard time understanding how they could have done this in English, so I will leave it at that.

I can't believe none of my three 30 something children ever read this book when they were in school but I guess it was pretty controversial when it first came out.

For large files, though, it's much slower than any other flash drive I have.  I bought the 16GB version so I could move large files back and forth between computers, but it's a bad choice for that role.  A 500MB file took almost 3 minutes to save on this drive (avg 3.5 MB/second), compared to a bit more than a minute on an old Sandisk Cruzer drive.
