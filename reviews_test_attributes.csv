1,-1,Pet_Supplies_5,4,"Seems to work so far. I have an 80 pound lab mix and this harness is a great buy. I had to replace a couple of the collars, so it is a nice change. It is a good size for a small dog. I like the shape of the collar, but it is a bit heavier than I expected. It is a little heavier than I expected. I would not buy this again. It is a little hard to see around the house."
2,-1,Toys_and_Games_5,5,"I got this on a lighting deal.  The plates come front to front, back to back, so you do not have worry about un-sticking them.  The size is not huge, so you can build rooms and still move the characters around.  The pillars can be used as walls, but it would use of many for a single room.  I  plan to keep an eye out for the next lighting deal on these.  They can be used as display stands or as buildings.  I have used them as holders for loos bricks so they do not roll of the table."
3,-1,Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,"I had this in my pocket for the last 30 years.

The only reason I ordered this is because I had a lot of leftover junk in the wallet, so I decided to return it.

I will be using it for a few years and see how it holds up.

I will also add the fact that I had to replace one of the pockets with this one because I didn't want to put the items on the counter.

This item is very well made.

The only thing I wish I had known about it was that it is made of a plastic, but that is why I bought it.

I have not used it for a long time, but it does a good job.

I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a good quality product.

Knife clicks open securely, pliers are sturdy and strong, it's heavy and feels like it will last a long time.  Another nice thing is that the knife is on the outside, unlike some leatherman designs, so you don't have to open the pliers to access the knife.

18,-1,Pet_Supplies_5,5,"I cannot explain how incredibly fantastic it is to have the love of my life (my little Buddy) tucked safely away in his sleepypod while driving. He used to love to sit behind my neck, draping himself over my shoulder.  Cute? Yes. Safe? No! How could I forgive myself if we had an accident and he went flying? I adore him, and even though it took about three days for him to accept being in here, it's worth it. I would buy this again and again and again.

Bottom line: Yes, it's awesome to have our puppies out and about while traveling, but it only takes one strong hit of the brakes to send them flying, and they will perish. Not worth it.  Watch the crash tests on this item. It passes. It is sturdy, comfortable, and uses the strength and safety of your car's seat belts to keep your pet as safe as possible."

23,-1,Movies_and_TV_5,4,"Barbet Schroeder is a very talented director. His main concerns have always been related with the dark side of the human soul.

This singular movie is a very careful analysis of the human psyche seen under a prism. Schroeder would have minutely followed the traces of ""The crime considered as one of the finest arts"" , the smart essay of Thomas de Quincey. Hitchcock, certainly inspired himself to make his famous movie: ""The Rope"".

But if you analyze the smart script with major intensity, you will find clever clues, like the first shot, in that enraptured camera movement that came into the hall window reminds us to: Psycho.

But there is still more, the well known mechanism of oppression and subjection between this weird couple is expressed with genuine fineness through expressive narrative ellipsis.

On the other hand we have to Sandra Bullock' s character who decides to investigate them through the night with a camera; which suggests us a modern Peeping Tom; I mean: James Stewart's role in ""The rear window"".

And finally we have the climatic sequence is another glorious tribute to ""Vertigo"". If you take into account all these hidden traces you will have to admit only Schroeder avoided this thriller had reached so higher peaks.

Perhaps, the only default of the movie resides in the limited scale of psychological grimaces of Sandra Bullock, but this is a minor failure in this intelligently unusual thriller."
24,-1,Toys_and_Games_5,5,"Highly recommend. I have others of these and grandson never gets tired of them. Watch out for tiny pieces if  you have a child who puts things in their mouths however, but it's the silverware/plates/cups only on that.

39,-1,Electronics_5,5,"Needed some long cables to hook up charging stations for my wife and my Kindles at our bed.

These do the trick.  Nicely constructed with solid feeling connectors.

Best thing about these is they are supple but not flimsy.  Many cables have a tendency to revert to their coiled status after long periods of being packaged which makes running behind furniture and such a royal pain.  These go where you put them and stay there, lying flat and not trying to curl up out of reach under the bed.

Most cables are good and these are better than most.  Both ends plug in solidly without undue force and with no feeling of ""slop"".  I've had many that tend to slide back out of the Kindle end of things without warning.  These do not do that."

Takes some thinking to put together, took about 1.5 hours.  Heavy unit.  Nice cover to cover up the mistake.
If I had a factory job putting these in boxes to send to my trading partner, I would hang my head low.

The villain doesn't shoot him in the head or the chest? They come out of a forest to a train station that has only one stop and no one notices?  Neither main character can get their access card into the card reader, although they have been standing in line watching all the people in front of them insert the card.  The guards let someone suspicious approach them, even though they have their gun drawn?  The guy is planting explosives and not keeping them on a short fuse, so the bad guys, who are watching on video can disarm all ten to fifteen of them? I mean, please?  Sorry; only so many hours in my life.  Not enough to read the next two books.  This doesn't even get to any type of twisted issue with the villain causing a miscarriage as some type of revenge on the father."

64,-1,Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,"I received this tool as a gift. It is well made and very useful, especially with trim molding and almost anything that requires an angle on the sliding miter saw. However, the scale was misaligned by one full degree. I called Starrett and was told that their tolerance for this tool is +/- one degree. That is unacceptable from a company like Starrett renowned for their  precision. I exchanged the tool for another, hand selected from inventory, and found one just .1 degree misaligned after looking at a dozen or so. This is workable accuracy but IMO the tool should be engraved, and the scale should be accurate or the scale should be eliminated. The decal itself may be accurate but the application process seems to produce a fair number of these tools with misaligned scales. With a sliding miter saw this is not really a problem as you can just transfer the angle. But, if the scale is there it should be accurate or at least installed properly. With the scale accuracy problems it rates three stars. If the scale were properly installed and accurate, I would give it 5 stars. Then I would not have to use my engraved Starrett protractor to read the actual angle when needed."

I have a real objection to ""series"" books when the rest of the series is not available at the time. I almost always hate how they end.  I am an avid reader - I read 3 to 5 books a week.  There is no way I want to pick up on the story several months from now to see what happened. If it were available now, I probably would have purchased the 2nd in the series but most probably will not purchase now....who knows when the third one will be available?  I know all the authors do this but I think it is a big mistake.  I like my stories to have an ending - then if I have enjoyed the book, I will definitely purchase more by that author."

The first few chapters was more of a validation of what I was already doing. I did pick up some new ideas in the later chapters. I did take to heart some of what was in this book. Truth be told, this book was a little more religious based then I would normally have been comfortable with.

116,-1,Electronics_5,3,"I've been using this tablet for about a year. It's a good tablet for the price.  There are three problems that may affect your purchase. It does not have enough disk space. I use it mainly to read newspapers, surf the web, read email and play one game. I have Office installed. No other software yet there isn't enough space for updates.  The second problem is battery life. This says 6 hours. Maybe on standby but if you are using the tablet, expect that you'll only get 2-3 hours. Lastly the keyboard is awful. I do not have large hands but the keys are so small that I'm constantly deleting text or bringing up a pop up menu. I have a third party external keyboard that I bought to use with this and its a wireless full sized keyboard that works well. But I'm don't always have it nearby.

After I installed the sink with strainer stopper down would not hold water, A full sink would leak out in an hour. Problem easy to solve!  The strainer has a slight tolerance defect that is easy to fix. The bottom of the strainer is slight bowed up holding the stopper too slightly too high so the water leaks out. Put the strainer on top of the open jaws of a vice and center a socket  over the stopper handle at the center of the strainer then hitting it downward. This causes the strainer bottom to now bow down a bit. This allows the O-ring to seat properly, problem solve. Yea water stayed in the sink all night.

I've been working in the industry for six years, and I just wrapped up principle photography on a feature length PBS documentary. I shoot 1080p high definition HDV video and the ONLY mini-DV tape stock I trust is Panasonic AY-DVM63PQ, better known as Panasonic PQ, for ""professional quality."" Although this tape is designed for DV video, I shoot HDV (high definition video) on it all the time. In my experience, it performs just as well as HDV tape, if not better. I have shot literally hundreds of hours of 1080p high definition video on this tape stock, and I've almost never had a dropped frame. Do NOT buy the cheaper consumer-grade tapes (e.g. DVC tape). Those cheap consumer tapes are a recipe for disaster. If you use cheap consumer tapes, frames will be dropping like flies. The bottom line is that professional work requires professional tape, and professional tape doesn't get better than this. This tape is incredibly reliable, and perfect for archiving. I just pulled some archived tapes off the shelves, 3-4 years old and still playing back at perfect quality, no signs of degradation at all. This stuff LASTS! Unbeatable quality for the price.

Initially I used a paper filter in a pour-over Hario setup to strain the stove brewed coffee.  This worked decently well, but I wanted to experiment with a good metal screen too.

Unfortunately for small children, it's too bulky to really stack, and the drum and tambourine are too difficult to remove.  The piano plays pre-set songs, or tracks of songs, rather than notes, so children have to listen thru before they engage again.  Would have preferred individual sounds as (at least) an option.  Because of the way the sound settings work, and the ease in which the cymbal can activate, ours essentially plays one song over and over again.

In fact, the aluminum seems to be powder coated smoothly enough to be able to hold pieces together for things like wooden picture frames, without marring them, at least until you use them as welding clamps and get weld spatter on them.  There is even enough clearance for a nail gun, to tack the pieces together, if you would want.
Precisely made, I consider these to kind of fudge the line between light duty and medium duty as far as welding clamps go.  I checked the angle with a machinist's square, and it was right on.

The Nameless Dwarf Omnibus contains the first three stories following the dwarf known only as Nameless.  If you have read some of Derek's other work than you may be familiar with him as he has been a companion of Shadrak the Unseen and Deacon Shader.

The book starts out with Nameless being a very mysterious figure who has hired a boy from the Night Hawks (a criminal group) to help him find information on where his people have fled to.  Nils, his companion, is the son of the leader of the guild out to prove his worth as a man.  During the journey they meet up with Silas, a magic user, who is studying the stolen grimoire of the Liche Lord Otto Blightey.  At the end of Ant-Man Ilesa joins up with the group as well.  She is a woman who seems to have some level of skill with shapeshifting/illusion magic.  As the stories progress the characters true natures are revealed as their stories are unraveled.  Derek has done a wonderful job keeping the main story on point while gradually revealing the backgrounds of all the people involved.

The book starts out with a lot of information and someone who is unfamiliar with the world Derek has created might struggle a bit at first.  As the book progresses everything comes together beautifully and by the end I didn't want to stop reading for any reason.  I will also be checking out the next story in the series, The Ebon Staff as soon as possible to see what will happen.

175,-1,Movies_and_TV_5,5,"This is turly the film the defines what little good (if any)that came out of the bad war. A story of the few victories the the American forces face.
Most of the battles in Vietnam were fought in back roads, and backyards, and very few large scale battles. This showed the horrible price that US troops pay in the first real offensive battle.
A platoon was pinned down, and other platoon rush to there rescue, only to be slaughter WWI style, the final battle sence, a classic unrealistic WWII battle charge.
But remember this was the very START of the conflict, and we knew little about jungle and gurilla warfare.
There was only one thing that cheezed me. It was Moore's (Gibson)
remark on the M16. ""It's a good rifle.""
Sure the M16A1 was a great rifle, A2 even better, but the oringal M16 by Euegne Stoner (if my history is correct) was a HORRIBLE rifle, it was rumored to be self-cleaning which lead to
abuse and missuse. The perellent was dirty and it had to be clean ever fifteen minutes, whole platoons were found with there M16 broken down and cleaning kits out."

I guess if I get a year out of these I can afford another pair next year at this price."

I received it with the thermal glue already dried up, so I used GE silicone II to mount the extra heatsinks. If you do this, make sure the heatsink stays in place for at least a full day and let the stuff cure before using the card.
The cold plate did not make proper contact with the core on a Gigabyte 390, so that card is now useless, due to a cracked core.
On the plus side, it dropped the temperatures on an overclocked XFX 270X by 30 degrees, so it got temperatures like 30 degrees above ambient while stressed with Furmark. The overclocked 270X this was put on served me well, but it is starting to crash (driver-related blue screen) with any overclock at all. Does anyone know what could be causing this issue?

201,-1,Books_5,5,"Alice wakes up one day on the floor of her gym only to discover ten years of her life have passed without her even knowing it. Last she remembers, she was eagerly anticipating the arrival of her first child, now she has three kids and an unhappy marriage. She is also experiencing a strained relationship with her sister and her mother has made startling life changes, as well. The entire book is a contrast and comparison between her ""younger"" mind and her ""older mind. "" Her younger self was filled with hope and excitement and joy, while her older self is stressed, unfulfilled and fighting feelings of resentment and overall unhappiness. Moriarty uses the character of Alice to explore some very philosophical questions. Every moment of our lives is made up of choices and for Alice, she has just fast-forwarded through 10 years worth of choices. Moriarty takes a fascinating concept and infuses it with beautiful writing, relatable characters and a powerful story line. WHAT ALICE FORGOT also examines the amount of change that can happen to a person in a 10 year period and how these changes make us more interesting and complex individuals but can also create issues that we wish we could undo. Alice wakes up to find that she has become a person she no longer recognizes, it is now up to her to find out where things went wrong and to see if she can change what she seems to have forgotten. I loved this book and can't recommend it highly enough."

Lonely and destroying more than he seems to save, not caring what anyone thinks or how they view his escapades, Hancock drinks, curses and half-heartedly saves those in danger.  Among those he saves is Ray, an advertising and marketing guy, who attempts to change Hancock's image so that the world will value him as a ""true"" hero.  With new purpose, a new attitude, and a new outfit, Hancock finds the answers to a lot of questions that he has been searching for (including who and what he is), from an unlikely and surprising source (another of his kind).

While some may not like the ending, if you really think about it, what other outcome could there be, where everyone would be happy? Those who are immortal and will live forever will eventually have the ending that we all want, it will just take patience.  The peace and calm that Hancock finds shows us his true spirit.  After all, what is waiting another few years to find complete happiness, for someone who waited 80 years to discover the truth about who he is?"

I like the access to my phone it provides without having to twist and squirm to get it off my bicep when I am running (skipping songs, etc). The sizing seems correct. My forearm is 12"" around and it fits snug but is not constricting. It seems to be very well made with good stitching and a nice, comfortable padding on the back. The fabric wicks moisture as it is supposed to and is very cool feeling. When I am traveling and running, I just slide my room key in there too. It is perfect as far as I am concerned and had exceeded my expectations."

215,-1,Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,"I purchased this after a friend recommended it to me.  I am not a power baker.  I merely make the usual things for my family and the occasional specialty items.  I find it mixes faster than my old stand mixer, and it takes less space on my counter.  Contrary to other reviewers, I find it does cream sugar and butter well, BUT I have to use a rubber spatula to push it off the center post.  MY machine came with instructions to NOT use the center addition for the smaller jobs like this since it produces better results, so that is how I have done it.

In addition, I noticed straightaway that the directions stated to ensure you run the machine at least 5 minutes before you do ANYTHING in it to make sure the lubricants do their job BEFORE you use it for mixing. I did that, and I've heard no odd noises coming from my machine.

It IS loud.....much louder than my stand mixer, but I wasn't going for a silent machine.  Frankly, I have dexterity issues, and I wanted one that wasn't overly heavy, with a bowl that wasn't overly heavy, and that was easy to clean without having to wrestle it all over the kitchen (with my issues, that's common).  My friend suggested that this would probably tick off all those checkboxes, and she was right.

For what I use it for, I LOVE it.  It is also easy to clean, the parts store in the top, and it does what I ask it to.  I also got the blender attachment with mine, and it blends stuff that my bullet cannot.  I don't use it OVERLY often, but when I need a blender, it's a champ.  The only thing I don't like about the blender is that you cannot remove the bottom and blades to clean it.  If I used it daily or for anything very sticky, that would bother me, but I'm just a batter making, smoothie making gal, and it's great for that."

Swank plays an astronaut who along with Bruce Greenwood must pilot Virgil, a craft designed to burrow (with the assistance of one really mean laser beam) to the earth's core in an attempt to correct an imbalance that was doing serious damage to the surface above.
Also along on this unbelievable trip to the earth's center are  respectable performers in stereotypical roles: Aaron Eckhart (the voyage's ""studly"" college professor), Alfre Woodard (mission commander), Delroy Lindo (the ship's inventor and symbol of self-sacrifice), Stanley Tucci (the despicable scientific genius with a hidden agenda), and Richard Jenkins as the mysterious military hardliner.

What was in the box from Amazon. I planned to open it later, but my nosy family insisted on seeing what I had. So, I finally opened my package. I had 3 items in there from Amazon, one of which was a pretty little black box. I opened it knowing it would be these earrings. As soon as I took them out of the box everyone oooed and ahhhhhh'd. Then they all said they look really expensive. My mother had recently celebrated her 75th birthday, which is in May. She grabbed them out of my hands and said she loved them and that this was her birthstone, so she would like to have them. She told me she would give me a check for them once she got home. My mother is a simple lady and not materialistic at all, so the fact that she was so taken by these speaks volumes for the quality. She then put them in her ears and proudly wore them home. I told her that since she loved them so much I wanted her to keep them as another gift for her special birthday.
These are gorgeous, well made and they did come with the different backings. One is called a butterfly backing, and not sure what the other is called. Anyway, I guess I will be ordered another set and will not be opening in front of anyone, lol.
I and the rest of my family would recommend them. They are small, but impressive. It is true what they say that good things come in small packages.

Love and family is always worth the work as Sarah and Max discover. Of course, a little Christmas magic never hurts either. A valuable lesson to be learned. Delightful read. One of my favorites of this series.

257,-1,Books_5,5,"I'll admit, it was the mention of a unicorn that attracted me to WARPED, so I was totally unprepared for the epic storyline that I discovered within the covers of this debut novel.

After reading just a few pages of WARPED, in which the Fates examine and manipulate the threads of life they rule over, I was completely dedicated to finding out what would happen next. The Fates have always fascinated me and Guibord's unique treatment of the related mythology was exceedingly clever. The idea that someone might steal life threads from The Fates for their own nefarious use... ingenious!

To add to the mayhem, Tessa finds herself falling for William de Chaucy, who is as alluring as he is maddening. I enjoyed the push and pull between these characters. They both have strong personalities that don't always mesh and neither controls the other... they're very much equals.

WARPED is one of the most creative YA contemporary fantasy novels I've ever read. Guibord combines magic, time travel, and mythology to create a fantastic story with a convincing villain and a much deserved happily ever after."

This gun feels very flimsy.....it's working fine, but I wouldn't give this gun to a kid, I don't think it'll handle abuse well.  While other reviewers claim this gun is powerful, mine isn't, at least compared to my Crosman.  I can penetrate cardboard with my Crosman from a few yards away; this gun can only penetrate cardboard at point blank range.  Also, the hop up in this gun is crooked, so all my shots deviate to the right.  It's consistent, but still kind of irritating, considering that my Crosman, which costs about the same, shoots straight.

Overall, the Crosman Marines airsoft rifle is the best one out there in the cheaper/entry level airsoft guns, so if you're getting one, get the Crosman and pass on this."

Now by illuminate I don't mean everyone will be reading books by this light, although if you sat close you could - I mean that it was a soft illumination for the entire room.  I didn't remove the protective pad for the magnet so didn't use that feature.  It's expensive, but oh so worth it.  Provided much more usable lighting than our traditional Stanley flashlight.  I had neighbors ask me why our house looked so lit up and I got to brag on this flashlight.

296,-1,Toys_and_Games_5,5,"I have spent some amount of time playing with this walnut sized wonder. It is unexplainably addictive. Maybe it's the rather cool free apps that Ozobot has available for it. Maybe it's the color changing LED lights. Maybe it's the way you calibrate and tune it. The cool factor is just off the charts. I like the Ozobot Dance app the best. You place it on a space and with light flashes it programs this little beast. Then you press play and it signals the robo critter to do it's thing. It will go on top of your tablet or phone spinning, flashing and scooting along.

It must have taken quite some engineering to come up with this. To distill it for you it's sensors can detect lines and colors. It will change what it's doing, program itself and perform all of it's functions that way. Everything you need comes in the box. A couple of things to share with you: Instructions say you need to calibrate and tune it every time before you use it. But you can use it a few times without doing that, it seems if you only wait a few moments before uses it seems to hang on to it's setup. But if it's shut off for more than a few minutes you definitely need to go through the calibration/motors tune process (very easy).

It's not entirely perfect all the time during the tune process. Sometimes it seems to forget what it's doing, you just put it back in it's start position and usually it will be fine. Occasionally you will turn it off then repeat the tuning process. It's not a hassle. The whole experience is fun. Registration is free and gives you access to a lot of extras at no charge. I love this little nugget of technology. I've attached a picture with a sugar packet in comparison to give you an idea of it's true size. Sample for fair review."

He knows what he wants from life and how he is going to get it.  The only thing that throws him off is how much he wants his best friend Zoe McCleary.  Jericho biggest issue with Zoe is she does not commit to anything.

Zoe McCleary says and does whatever pops into her head.  She is still in school because she has changed her major multiple time.  She is at a point the guardian in charge of her trust tells her to pick something and stick it through or he is giving all her money away.  Zoe comes across as flighty and unreliable.  It seems the one thing that no one sees is that Zoe is head over heels in love with Jericho.  That is the one thing she sticks too.

The chemistry between Zoe and Jericho is blistering.  I loved that they finally acted on their feeling for each other.  The sex scenes were steamy.  My biggest issue with this book is that everyone including Jericho seem to constantly put Zoe down.  While Jericho does, stick up for her he seems to agree with those picking on her.  I wonder if any of those ever thought that Zoe unable to commit had something to do with worrying about what everyone around her was saying and constantly trying to please those around her.

I found this book very well written.  The main and secondary characters were interesting and realistic.  I loved that there was a story line beyond just Zoe and Jericho falling in love with each other.  While I have not read the other books in the series, this book can be read and enjoyed as a standalone novel.  Overall, this was a great story.

This supplement has kept her very healthy, her coat is very shiny, and her appetite is very good.  My ferret is very small and this has kept her weight on because it provides her with a healthy appetite.  My vet recommended this item to me during my first visit because she is so small, and keeping weight on her is very important.

What I love most about this item is how crazy my girl gets when she sees the tube, she does a cute little dance, and fluffs up her coat.  She could be in the other room and I will tap the tube in my hand and she will come running.  This is a great company that makes great products and has kept my ferret healthy. This Vitamin Supplement has a good list of vitamins for their overall health.  Most of all the taste seems to be very appealing to my girl.

I would recommend this item to any ferret owner as a supplement and also if you are having problems getting your ferret to eat or maintain weight, give her or him some of this prior to their meal and their appetite should be good to go in about 10 minutes or so.  Sometimes their appetite could be affected by hairballs so I would also recommend adding a hairball aid to their weekly health regime and after baths too."

 5 STAR REVIEW 

Pennie loved to read and that is why she was involved in her monthly book club. She was always comparing those book boyfriends she was reading about. Her social life was missing between her school work and her tight budget there was not much for her to do. But her life would change forever once she finds face to face with Carter, a woman that stop at anything to obtain what she wants. Carter was a business woman and she knew she had to be ruthless in her cut-throat world. When she finds herself with Pennie she knew she wanted to have her, protect her and love her in her own way. However there is a whole lot of issues they will have to face in order for her to be happy with Pennie. Carter and Pennie don't have the conventional relationship, but they know they are good for each other but how far will they are willing to go to achieve their happily ever after?

Well let me tell something this is my first F/F romance and I was surprised how this book had so much to offer. The plot had you sucked in and you will want to read the whole book before you put it down. This book will show you the lengths someone is willing to go for the person they love and no matter how you get there the only thing matters is how you will take it from that point on. I love this book and I will recommend for everyone to read this book. Gifted by author in exchange for an honest review. https://www. facebook."

I think the show was canceled because the producers had to make a deal with the syndication company that syndicated it.  The syndication company is owned by the syndication company, and they want to sell the show.  They are looking for a way to get the syndication company to put the show on air, and I think that would be a good thing.  It would be nice if they would put it on air, but it would be hard to get it on air.  They would have to sell it on a weekly basis, and that would be a problem.

374,-1,Books_5,5,"Wallace Thurman was an influential figure in the Harlem Renaissance, the era of heightened creativity in writing, art and music that arose in Harlem following World War I. In Thurman's short life he wrote novels, plays, poems and essays and started two magazines. A bohemian who drank and partied hard, he died at age thirty-two of tuberculosis.

The Blacker the Berry, first published in 1929, gives a fascinating picture of Harlem in the 1920s with its vibrant street life, easy sex, wild house-rent parties and black cabarets frequented by thrill-seeking whites.

The story follows the many tribulations of young Emma Lou Morgan. The tragedy of her life is not being black, but too black. Her light-skinned mother is ashamed of her dark-skinned daughter.

An alien in her own family, Emma Lou is universally snubbed in her hometown of Boise, Idaho, where high browns and half whites rule Negro society. Even at college in Los Angeles, the colored sorority won't have her. Harlem is her last chance to find a haven from the color snobbery within her own race.

Emma Lou, however, brings her troubles with her wherever she goes, for she too is a color snob. She'll fall for a light-colored good-for-nothing over an intelligent black man every time. Emma Lou's experiences make painful reading at times, but eventually open her eyes and give her new hope.

Wallace Thurman was an acute social critic, and his satirical talent is full strength in The Blacker the Berry."

This is merely a limited animation rendering of the artwork with music and voice acting.  In this case it's pretty well done and I personally think they are getting better as they go on.

This one is a lot more ambitious then the prior installments in terms of action.  I originally thought this would be another Wolverine story but it does a good job at show casing a range of characters.  I enjoyed the Terminator by way of super heroes plus some Robocop for good measure story even if Jason Aaron can be hit or miss with me.  The voice acting is improving as well and I've come to accept Brian Drummond as a pretty good Wolverine.  Besides he's Canadian so he's a shoe in.

It was cool to see a rather under used character like Deathlok get show cased.  I hope Marvel Knights starts to move more in this direction as they continue.  Also surprised they couldn't interview Aaron for this.  Made the special feature seem less interesting.

Another complaint is I didn't think it was made clear that the Deathlok internalizing is supposed to be the same one every time.  With that little bit of spoiler free information the whole thing makes a lot more sense.  They still don't explain him that well though or why he has Wolverine claws and an Ironman hand.

Anyway let's see some more.  Ghost Rider, Moon Knight, Iron Fist, Dr. Strange, Hawkeye, who is next?"

French bread:1 1/3 cups Water; warm
1 1/2 tbsps olive oil
1 1/2 tsp. Salt
2 tbsps Sugar
4 cups bread flour
2 1/4 tsp. Yeast
Original recipe makes 14

servingsResize
Preparation

Place the warm water into your bread pan. Be sure the kneading paddle is in place. Then add the olive oil, the salt, and the sugar, in this order. Add the flour, covering the liguid. Make a small indentation on top of the center of the flour, but not deep enough to reach the liquid. Add the yeast to this indentation. (Adding the ingredients in this order is important, especially when using the timer. It keeps the yeast away from the liquid ingredients until it is time to knead them together. Liquid ingredients will prematurely activate the yeast.) Now you are ready to set your bread pan in the machine and set the timer or choose the French Bread Cycle. This recipe makes a 2lb loaf.

Whole WheatFor 1 1/2 lb. bread machine
1 1/4 cups water
2 tablespoons (7/8 ounce) olive or vegetable oil
1/4 cup honey or maple syrup
3 1/2 cups (14 ounces) King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat or Traditional Whole Wheat Flour
1/4 cup sunflower, sesame or flax seeds, or a combination (optional)
1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast

Put all of the ingredients into the bread pan in the order listed. Program for basic white bread, and press Start.

both these use oil which i find much easier that cutting up butter and no dry milk or molasses needed or other ingredients I might not have on hand needed."

Wyatt is the oldest son of Joe and Cassidy Black. He has been deemed the heartbreaker, by many and he hates that title. Wyatt is looking for something special he just doesn't know what that special is until he see Nellie. Nellie has come back home to California, but she is also running away from the trouble she left back in Seattle. The trouble is not of her making, but of the crazy ex-boyfriend who didn't know much about Nellie as he thought that she did. When Wyatt first lays eyes on Nellie, he wants to lay not just eyes, but hands, mouth and body. Can Wyatt overcome his ""Heartbreaker"" stigma and win Nellie mind, body and soul? or will this heartbreaker become one of the broken hearted?

So be advised: if you think it's not working, do check your output settings to be sure that it's not a problem with your default selection."
391,-1,Pet_Supplies_5,5,"My last Rottweiler, Jet, was a little too big for him.  We tried a variety of pet bedding and we had to get a larger one for him.  After a lot of research we decided to try this one.  We were skeptical about the size of the bedding but we were a bit surprised at how well it worked.  It's a bit big for him but it's just right.  It's a nice size for a large dog.

We have a small dog that is about 1 1/2 inches tall, so he was a bit small for this bedding.  It's definitely a bit large for him.  We have to get the bedding from the fabric and we have to get it off the dog.  It's also a little heavier for him than other beds we have.

It's a nice size for a small dog.  We've had this bedding for about a year and it's still in good condition.  It's a little tight on the dogs neck but it's not too tight for the large dog.

409,-1,Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,"We just bought this coffee maker to replace our 15 year old Krups model.  The Krups still works fine, but it was white and various areas were starting to show brown coffee staining. The only feature change we have noticed in 15 years is that now the water comes out in a shower head spread instead of a single drip line.  This model also has a charcoal water filter packet and comes with a permanent gold-tone coffee filter.

We like the looks of this coffee maker and we notice it does not show fingerprints on the plastic coated stainless steel finish.  Some people have commented that their coffee pots drip when they pour and that some lids are hard or impossible to remove for cleaning the lid or the pot.  The pot on this coffee maker does not drip and the lid is easy to remove completely for cleaning.

Finally, we note this coffee maker has a three year manufacturer's warranty.  Hopefully, if ours lasts three years it will also last for fifteen years like our previous Krups.

Update 10/18/13:

After one year of use the lid of our DCC-2650 began to deteriorate.  Apparently the heat and steam from normal brewing caused the clear plastic coating on the lid to begin cracking and crazing.  I have posted two images of the crazed areas. The coffee maker still works perfectly, but the lid is not very attractive on our countertop."

419,-1,Movies_and_TV_5,2,"You know, I've been a fan of these Paranormal Activity movies since it debuted a few years ago. The first and second movies were pretty decent, although you can tell they were made on a low-budget. The first two relied more on getting to know the characters and heavily on very slow-building tension, which is why I loved them so much. That makes me wonder why this one just went off-track. PA3 is, quite literally, a weak mess of a movie. You'd think these guys would up the wow factor of this movie, considering how the first two were, but no. I know they were trying to tell the backstory to the series but they could do that and still wow us. The acting was very dry and that made it unbelievable to me. I mean, the knockoff movie:Paranormal Entity, was way better than this one. I was really disappointed and just can't recommend anyone buy this movie. If you can find it in a bargain bin somewheres, okay-maybe then. But for full asking price-No. These guys better get their game on in the next movie or fans are going to jump ship, plain and simple."

If you are looking for something practical, I would say the same thing, you wouldn't be disappointed. If you are looking for something stylish and clean cut, this may not be you.

I had an Eheim 2211 and it worked as hard as it could, but it just wasn't cutting it, and it was an enormous hassle to prime it whenever it needed cleaning - and it needed cleaning constantly, because I was asking it to do too much. I knew I needed a bigger filter and as soon as I realized the Ecco was self-priming, I was sold.

Some key differences between the Ecco and the Classic:
1. The priming pump - huge key. I didn't find the plastic handle to be too flimsy, but I was also gentle with it after having read reviews. It primes so quickly and I don't have to worry about swallowing aquarium water!
2. There's only one nozzle on each tube that controls the flow rate, when on the Classic there was two. For me, this is just easier - less connections mean less possibility for leaks, and I only need one nozzle to control the flow rate anyway.
3. It is so much quieter. Maybe it's because I upgraded the size of the filter so much so it's working less, but I'm amazed that a filter so much bigger is so much quieter. It makes NO noise, it's actually incredible.

So all in all: powerful, quiet, easy to set up and easy to maintain. I'm so happy with it."

As usual, things go very wrong and the boys are separated, and then they find themselves fighting for their lives. In Prince of the Blood, Feist introduces Nakor, a new character of questionable character in the series, and with his help, Arutha's sons come out all grown up and smelling like a rose. Not to spoil it by mentioning names, but one character I loved loses his life in Kesh.

As usual Shimano continues to make perfect fitting high quality parts, it included the fixing bolts 2 X (M6x18.7mm) and a precision cut bracket.  To me the bolts seem a bit long, i'm used to a M6x15.2mm bolts.

487,-1,Kindle_Store_5,5,"The Glimpsing is an intriguing and haunting tale of revenge, love, hope, faith, courage, and the age-old battle of good vs. evil.

The author creates a very Twilight Zone atmosphere from the beginning of the book, with nods to Alfred Hitchcock, Rod Serling and Stephen King. Although I wouldn't classify it as a horror story, it incorporates the psychological horror and suspense for which the above three are recognized as masters.

Portia Childress, brought up by a mother who has the ability to ""glimpse"", see into the world just beyond our world, wants the one thing she can't find in her relationships with men: true love. How she deals with this unfulfilled need is the center of this tale.
The mysterious painting reminds me of aspects of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" and subsequent stories involving mysterious, ""changing"" paintings but this has its own unique flavor.

It is easy to identify with Portia's innocence and need but more difficult to understand where she went as result of it. Gabrielle, in spite of her own love for Jack, tries to remain loyal to Portia and to love her best friend. Jack's increasing feelings for Gabrielle only complicate the situation, bringing about some of the ensuing horrors.

My favorite character in this story, though a minor one was Jack's housekeeper, Janice. She has the wisdom to get an idea of what is going on after Jack first receives the mysterious painting, offers Gabrielle a way of dealing with her own guilt and ultimately is willing to risk dealing with something she is worried is beyond her ability to handle, because of her belief in doing the right thing.

This was a refreshing read, standing out among the current ""horror"" stories that I have read with its unique presentation of that battle between good and evil. Well worth the time invested in reading the book. Unfortunately because it would give away spoilers, I can't go into the details of the unique perspective presented in this story, but I think any fan of the horror/supernatural realm would enjoy the book"

Put them up on the 10th and here is it April 12 and they have been dark for 2 days already some a week.  The batteries are supposed to last for over 200 hours.. I got maybe 180 lite hours out of them.  Really disappointing.  I guess they would last longer if I would have just used the remote every night but that was what the time was supposed to be for.  I guess I will just leave them in for now as decoration.  I am not going to spend 5.00 a month on batteries for them.

The HTC comes with everything you need to assemble the base, while you have to provide your own hardwood for the Delta.  The HTC is adjustable to the nearest inch, making it a bit looser fit than the Delta (so, you still need some wood to shim your machine tight, or attach your tool to the stand).  I think the Delta would be harder to assemble if you didn't already have a drill press or some similar means of drilling a perfectly squared hole.  The rolling action of both is pretty comparable.  Overall, I'd probably choose this HTC over the Delta if I needed a third mobile base."

Camera is so light weight that it's hard for me to keep steady while walking, but then I'm a bit heavy and not so light on my feet. The access wheel on the LCD is a bit awkward but not bad once you get use to it. I always tend to spin it past where I want to be.

Not sure which software suite to buy even though the software that comes with it is good enough to transfer video files and still images. Don't like the idea of having to plug in the charger each time I want to transfer files.

The second part is patently false as it cost $16 each for each installed unit in our house and as one can clearly see here they cost more!  However, when you are in the mess of building a house, little things like research can get swept under the rug with work and the myriad decisions one has to make in a hurry.

549,-1,Kindle_Store_5,5,This series is one of the best that I have ever read. I love her work.
550,-1,Movies_and_TV_5,5,This is a really fun movie. The story is very good and the characters are very believable.
551,-1,Toys_and_Games_5,4,"If you're a parent/grandparent with a youngster just discovering the ""Cars"" movies, I can tell you that my husband and I have had a blast collecting these small, 1:55 scale Mattel models for our grandsons.  You definitely need a strategy if you plan to collect, since their are just SO many of them.  Hard enough trying to just figure out who all of the characters are!

Giuseppi Motorosi is the Italian-speaking pit crew chief for Lightning McQueen's primary rival, Francesco Bernoulli, in the Cars 2 sequel, both of them sporting the colors of the Italian flag, and they were actually sold together in a 2-pack last year (if you're just starting to collect, might want to check the 2-pack out in case it saves you.)  According to the cute little bios they put out on the characters, Giuseppi is designed as a 1966/69 Alpha Romeo Duetto, a former racer himself until he had a major accident at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza race track on the Curva Parabolica (the final challenge of the race), and has now teamed up with Formula Race champ Francesco.  This - as with all of these little models - is very durable and nicely detailed... just be careful - if you get one of the crew chiefs, your youngster's bound to want them all!

This year Giuseppi is part of the 9-piece WGP Pit Crew collection, along with Alex Machino, Max Schnell's pitty (be careful about adding the racers' little forklift pitty characters too... there's a bunch of them!), Otto Bonn, Austin Littleton, and 2-packs of Manual Maniez/Bruno Motoreau and Jeff Gorvette's Pitty/John Lassetire."

553,-1,Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,"I am quite happy with this set and the materials. I will keep my review in mind when ordering. If you are a beginner, I would suggest reading the directions first."
554,-1,Books_5,5,"If you are thinking about buying this book think no more. For those of you who need a basic idea of what its about let me sum it up. Its about a boy who is a genius who believes in what most people would think inpossible and discovers it is not only true  but far more advanced. Fairies. But these aren't you sparkling flower fairies. These are gun weilding, electric winged, magic world police. Sworn to keep their world secret safe from all human kind. Nor is this boy just a genius, but also is one the worlds most wanted crimnals, to humans and fairies alike. And he just cracked the code. With mystery everywhere in the story( and along the pages for those who know and have cracked it) It is deffently an awsome read. Don't think anymore."
555,-1,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,"Fit: I wear size 9 ladies shoes, and the sock size 9-11 fits well, without pulling on the toes.  The leg portion is very comfortable, but the top of the band leaves an indentation in my leg, and that's why I dropped one star from these excellent socks.  I'm folding the tops down to avoid that, but in my active outdoor life, I prefer higher socks for protection against insect bites.

For running around the house in socks, these are wonderfully comfy.  Where they really shine, though, is when you put on your shoes, and they never felt so good!

Construction:  You can see in the picture the open mesh knit on the top of the foot for coolness.  There's a ribbed band that goes completely around your instep to hug your foot. The bottom of the sock, including the top of the toes and up the back of the heel (except for the area of the instep ribbing) is all cushioned with terry loop knit on the inside.  So the sole is thicker than the top, and it's very comfortable.  You have cushioning where you need it most, without making the socks too hot or bulky.

Materials: With years of experience knitting socks myself, I can advise that for long-lasting socks, get at least 10% nylon in the fibers.  These socks exceed that, and should wear very well.

These are my favorite store-bought socks yet, but I'll keep looking for something that doesn't leave an indentation on my calf.  You can bet I'll be wearing these often in the meantime, though, and especially in hot weather.

UPDATE: After several trips through the washer and dryer, they've shrunk, and feel uncomfortably tight, especially around my ankle.  They're still comfortable in shoes, but I limit how long I have them on because of the restrictive feeling."
556,-1,Pet_Supplies_5,4,"Very happy with this Bellrock Growers Pet Greens, initially... I followed the instructions except I used a planter and did 2 containers instead of the bag and I added some organic potting soil of my own, underneath the provided soil and seeds.

After a few days in the shade, they were sprouting. After 5 days, it was growing to a nice length but a bit sparse. After 7 days, it was full and plentiful. I trimmed it daily, it was growing so fast. A month later, I started seeing some browning and then a bit of mold in the dirt. I don't think I've over-watered as I've been careful hoping to prevent that.

One of our two kittens eats his grass daily, like a little lawn mower every morning, smile. The other occasionally bites some off and plays with it. I put some clippings in their nightly dinner. No issues with vomiting and they both eat it just fine.

At about a dollar an ounce, I considered it a good value. I'm not sure if I'd buy a bag every month though. After some research, I'm going to dump what I have, wash the containers and give it another go. Next round, I'm going to try a spray bottle for watering instead, to provide a lighter watering and hopefully prevent mold.

I read that overwatering cat grass turns the soil acidic and encourages root rot. Contagions and harmful fungi that prefer overly moist soil can infect the grass and make the grass toxic for pets.

Definitely worth keeping an eye on. I don't fault the product though as mold growth has everything to do with moisture. The grass was lush, green, healthy, and the roots are strong and deep. 4 stars because it only lasted us a month but we will give it another shot.

USDA Organic. Uploading some photos so you can get a closer look. The photo collage was after 5 days of growth, when the kittens first tried it. The last photo was on the 7th day, when the grass had become more full in growth. Smile. Recommended."

575,-1,Kindle_Store_5,5,"I don't know why I chose this book as the first book of Cole McCade to read but I am so glad that I did. This book is not for the faint of heart. It has strong elements of abuse and was very dark at times but still beautifully written. Poetic, lyrical, yet dark and gritty, raw and full of emotion. Leigh is an amazing young woman. She is strong yet broken, fragile and dangerously damaged. There were times that it was hard to read because she felt that she deserved what had been done to her. So as you hear in so many instances of abuse she continued to be abused (we read in great detail much of the abuse) and yet we see her grow stronger as the book continues until she finally decides that she will no longer be the victim and to finally fight for what she knows she deserves. The beautiful Gabriel is also broken but he is broken because of his choices to not feel the pain that was inflicted upon him by war. Gabriel sees the brokenness in Leigh and yet from the first time he meets he, he is drawn to her. There were just so many elements of this story that kept me reading it and not the least of which is Cole's ability to draw you into an emotional level with each character in the story, feel their pain (I have since learned that he does this because he has experienced it) and finally experience the freedom of love. Even with the rawness and grittiness, Cole turned this story into one of beauty. It is also evident that Cole is a great lover of books because there are ALOT of references to books, both subtly and not but he weaves them into the story beautifully. Even his acknowledgements were touching. Cole is definitely an author I will be following and reading and could there possibly be another story in the Crow City, fingers crossed!!"

582,-1,Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,"I've had a super-cheap yoga mat from TJ Maxx for the last ten years.  I purchased it for a couple of yoga classes I took years back and really haven't used it much since.  If and when I occasionally practice yoga, Pilates or Lotte Berk at home, I just work-out on the carpeted floor.  I ordered this on a whim, thinking it would just be a typical, teeny-tiny thin yoga mat to replace my old one.

But boy, I could not have been more wrong.

This is a high quality, super thick and about 50% longer than a standard yoga mat so it can be used for all manner of floor work.  It's lightweight (for easy portage) but still very supportive.  It rolls out pretty much flat (just one edge maintained a bit of a curl) and is easy to keep rolled up for storage with a convenient Velcro carrying strap that wraps tightly at both ends.  However, I wouldn't recommend it as a substitute for the yoga mat you might typically carry to a class because it's about twelve inches around when rolled.  But it's perfectly suited for home use.

The only problem I have is when you use VMWare to run Vista, I tend to lose connections with both the wireless keyboard and mouse (both bluetooth).  This problem doesn't go away when you quite VMWare.  I have to plug in the wired keyboard and mouse to continue.  A bit of annoyance, but won't be a problem if you don't use VMWare to run Windows.

619,-1,Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,"Great for line-tending when watching ice divers!!! The divers in the water are always clipped to a thick line but a person needs to be holding that line to send 'pull signals', to pull them back, etc. The problem is that ice diving occurs in water just above freezing, definite winter conditions above the water. Wearing normal winter ski gloves doesn't work because they soak through with water as you grab the line; these don't get wet on the inside unless you let water run into them from the opening (hard to do, these have really long wrist areas and you don't tend to raise your hands up high too much while line-tending). Hands stayed warm from the fleecy material inside (I tested them at approximately -10F).

I admit I was disappointed in these gloves out of the box because the seams had rough edges where they were fused together - but as long as you're not rubbing delicate skin (or something) with the outside of the glove, it isn't a problem at all.

I also tried these for summer kayaking in Alaska because my hands always got cold from the cool water. Wearing these gloves was too hot. Sweat made them soaking wet inside since they don't breathe.

I laughed my head off that anyone would try these for Alaskan winters (aurora viewing/vacation). These won't help you at -40 temperatures.

This one is the first one I have ever owned that made the mattress feel more supportive, more flat, and all around better to sleep on.  And the mattress is a top of the line Royal Pedic. This frame is built like a military war machine but anyone of average intelligence can assemble it, without tools of any kind, in about ten minutes.  No matter how you interpret the instructions put the wheels on first.  To get them to seat in the plastic inserts you will need a hard ( tile, concrete, steel, etc.) surface and straight line pressure.  Once in the plastic insert the wheels will easily seat in the frame.  The center ""T"" will only fit one way.  Do not force it.  If you are doing it properly, it will drop right in.  Get the wheeled version and off-set the locking wheels at opposite ends and sides.  When it is time to clean under the frame, you will be glad those wheels are helping you move it.  Don't worry about the cost.  You will never have to buy another bed frame, no matter how long you live, and you will never find one that will support your mattress and you nearly as well as this one."

633,-1,Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,"I bought this for using as a hydration pouch but decided that in that purpose, it was far inferior to the Camelbak Antidote. The zip opening and closure is not as secure as I would like the opening of a big bag of water to be inside a pack while moving around. It's also kind of awkward to fill from a spigot, sink faucet or bottle. The drink port is a bit awkward to use as well but its fine I guess. The bag itself seems sturdy enough and not likely to crack or puncture easily.

However, after setting it aside as a hydration bag, I decided to use this as a component in a gravity water filter, (one that I cobbled together with some extra tubing and fittings and the Sawyer Mini filter, but imitating the Platypus Gravity Works) specifically as the dirty water bag. The big zip top makes filling the bag from a natural source like a river or stream extremely easy and the handle thing on top with some paracord or long Nite Ize gear ties makes it easy to hang the bladder from a tree. For that purpose I give it 4 stars, only wishing that it was bigger than 3L to filter water for more than 1 person at a time at stops or in camp."

648,-1,Electronics_5,4,Checks off all the boxes for a very inexpensive TV
649,-1,Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,This pillow cushion is well constructed and easily washed. Very comfortable.
650,-1,Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,"I have used this for a few weeks and am very pleased with it.  First, it makes a good cup of coffee, even without factoring in the convenience.  I'm still trying different varieties.  The French Roast is so far my favorite.  By dialing in either 6, 7.5, or 9 oz, it is very easy to adjust the strength to your tastes.  I find even the 9 oz to be strong enough.

The build is very sturdy, better than most of the other pod coffee makers.  Charcoal filter in the water is a good idea for those living in the city.

Only disadvantages I see are that the machine is relatively expensive, it costs more per cup, of course, than a regular coffee maker, and your choices of coffees are more limited.  But if you only want one cup in the morning on the way out the door, it's certainly quick, with no mess, and leaves no wasted, leftover coffee.  I find it of good value."
651,-1,Movies_and_TV_5,5,"This is a wonderful family movie for older children and above. It is mostly about a man taking a chance and believing in himself and his vision. I loved how it showed the struggle his crew had with trusting his judgement at times, and the inner struggles each had with deciding whether or not they made the right decision to risk their lives on the venture. It doesn't have tons of action, but is a wonderful example of loyalty among friends, working together, and how humans can triumph over just about anything with planning, training, wisdom, and perseverance."

658,-1,Movies_and_TV_5,5,"I really can't suggest anything that would make this film better.  The acting is top notch, not just from DeNiro and Grodin, but from the entire cast.  Each character is well defined and believable. I especially liked Dennis Farina's parody of the tough-talking Mafia boss (""Shut up or I'll shove this pencil through your heart!""), and his two flunkies (Moron #1 and Moron #2). The dialogue is great, and the film is laced with humor--the best kind of humor, situational.  There is even a tender awkward moment (when Jack, DeNiro, visits his daughter whom he hasn't seen in years, and she offers to give him her babysitting money, which he feels he shouldn't take, although he needs it).  The action is non-stop, and if you have to suspend your disbelief at times, it is a small price to pay.

The evolution of the relationship between DeNiro and Grodin's characters, as has been mentioned, is the core of this picture. It is done magnificently and is the reason the film is so great. There are so many great scenes: when DeNiro and Grodin are eating dinner on the train, when they pretend to be from the Treasury Department in order to relieve a bartender of his ""counterfeit"" 20 dollar bills, the scene in the diner when Grodin, really hungry and broke, asks what's the special today, and the waitress says chorizo and eggs (dig the look on Grodin's face). DeNiro says they can't afford it, and Grodin counters ""How about your cigarettes?"", and DeNiro says, ""I need these.""  The film is chock full of these delicious scenes--I really can't think of a dull one.

This film is forever.  Buy it and see for yourself."

663,-1,Pet_Supplies_5,3,"It is very, very small. It's a great concept, but it does not work for large, active dogs. The Velcro will not hold up to roughhousing, and if you loose your tags, you're screwed. Some people suggested that you can leave the tags attached to the O-ring and just slip them in the pouch, but still, you run the risk of the pouch ripping away. I ended up putting this on my cat and putting his rabies tag in it since he is an outdoor/indoor cat. He doesn't wander off, but instead of having to go thru the hassle to send it back, I just decided to put it on him.

Back to looking for more solutions, and it sucks because I bought 2 brand new tags for my dog so I could put them in this pouch. I just didn't realize it was going to be so small. It's almost the size of two postage stamps laid top to bottom. My husband suggested I put the tags on a carabiner and then unclip it from her at night and when she is in the house so we don't have to listen to them jangle. Then I can just clip the carabiner back on her when she goes outside."

UPDATE Dec-31-2013:

HitLights has sent me the updated bulb for 2014 to compare with the older bulb, and I'm pleased to say it is much improved from the old design. I'm also pleased they offered to send my a new bulb free of charge to try. Thats good customer service! First off the height of the bulb is now normal. It will not stick out of the fixture you place it in, like the old bulb did. The bulb looks exactly like what they have in the current pictures. I measured the new bulb as consuming 3.9 watts, which is more efficient than the old model (4.4 watts) and the same as my old favorite, the G7. The new bulb is a lot brighter too. I measured it at 5100 lux @ 1 foot away, compared to the old model @3860 lux. Its still not as bright as the old G7 at 7200 lux. But its acceptable. It comes on instantly and has a fairly linear dimming ability with a standard Lutron dimmer. It does have a little bit of yellow fringing at 1 foot away, but over several feet onto my dark brown granite countertop, it was mostly unnoticeable. Since the G7 is not available now, I would not hesitate to give this bulb a try. G7 however has redesigned their GU10 style bulb and it should be available soon. I always prefer products made in the USA, like the G7. I'm pretty sure this HitLights is still made in China."

690,-1,Electronics_5,3,"I have always liked Wacom products and that includes its Bamboo styluses. The one I have used before just had a pen clip which actually worked well for my iPad case. I have always liked the styluses that are able to plug into the headphone/speaker port because I don't use it often so I it makes sense to have a solid place to keep my stylus with my iPad.

This product is reminiscent of the elago, which also has the retractable and speaker port pen feature. It also includes some colored rings that you can swap out for customization, though I think the silver looks the cleanest and most expensive.

The functionality is fine. It writes well and fits in your hand well. I'm just not a big fan of the girth of the product but it does allow for better grip and writing. However, the rubber grip does make the product look a bit cheaper, as it has dots in them and holds onto lint and dirt strongly and easily.

For the price, I think the elago is a much cheaper and comparable option. This product just doesn't look as sleek and clean as the other styluses in both elago or Wacom's repertoire."

The action sequences are well done.  Some of the special effects are very good.  The special effects are a bit too intense.  Overall, ""Valentine"" is a solid movie.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys action and adventure.I like this movie very much.  I have watched it about 1,000 times, and I am not sure how many times it has been viewed by other people.  This movie was a good introduction to my daily routine.  I had some problems with the writing, but I thought it was good.  It's a good movie for a young person to watch.  I have no problems with the sound.  I just wish they had used some audio or video capture techniques.  It was good to see some of the actors in the movie.  The acting was good, and the characters were believable"

709,-1,Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,"I swim everyday as part of my exercise regime, and whenever I do not protect my eyes, they burn and become pink from the harsh chlorine in the water. I wanted a good quality pair of goggles to help me keep my eyes safe, and the Ipow Anti-fog Mirrored Silicone Swimming Goggles with UV Protection Plating Glasses + Premium Goggles Case seemed like an excellent option for me, so I decided to try it out.

These goggles seal watertight against my face, completely protecting me from water leaking through them and onto my eyes. They are cushioned, and their head strap is a comfortable silicone material. The lenses of the goggles are described by the manufacturer as anti-fogging, and so far I have not experienced any issues with fogging. They seem to live up to their claim. I feel comfortable wearing these goggles, and my eyes are wonderfully protected from burning and irritation caused by the chlorine water.

I truly do love these goggles. They are great for casual swimmers like myself, who just use them for exercise or for simple fun in the pool, but they would also be ideal for competitive swimmers. Their quality is very high, and they are so comfortable and effective. I am so happy that I ordered them. I intend to get a lot of use out of these goggles, and I believe that they will last me for a very long time.

I must disclose that this product was received at a discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion was not altered due to the product being discounted.

This particular unit has a 7 gallon capacity, a glass-lined tank, and a recovery rate of almost 7 gallons per hour.

In my review video I cover the main features and issues with this water heater, but briefly:

This 7-gallon heater is large! The dimensions are 17.5 W x 17.5 H x 14.5 D. This was too large to install in our bathrooms or kitchen, so we had to install this in our basement crawlspace.

Also keep in mind that the unit itself weighs about 30 pounds, and with the extra weight of 7 gallons of water, the total weight of the heater will be almost 90 pounds. We set the heater on cement blocks to make a firm foundation.

Hooking up the plumbing to the unit is relatively straightforward, though in our case, because we installed the unit in our basement, we had to tap into the hot water run.  But this location would also not cause any house damage if the unit leaked.

Hooking up the electricity was more difficult, since we had to hire an electrician to make a hard-wired 12A and 120V connection the heater needs.

We are happy with this unit. The time it takes to get hot water is much shorter than it used to be, and seven gallons is enough of a reserve that we don't deplete it before our main hot water heater kicks in.

So all in all we have been very happy with this Bosch water heater, though again keep in mind the size and weight limitations of the 7-gallon unit.

I hope this review has been helpful!"

A Tough Winter
Pups Is Pups
Teacher's Pet
School's Out
Helping Grandma
Love Business
Little Daddy
Bargain Day
Fly My Kite
Big Ears

Jackie Cooper shines here as he falls for his teacher Miss Crabtree and has to compete with Chubby Chaney in ""Teacher's Pet"", ""School's Out"" & ""Love Business"".
Wheezer takes the main stage in ""Pups IS Pups"" but the early gang is all there as they invade an animal show with their exotic pets.
The gang's love for an elderly lady who acts as their Grandmother is heartwarming yet great fun in ""Helping Grandma"" & ""Fly My Kite"".
One clinker here is ""Big Ears"" which is a melodrama dealing with divorce.

Over all Volume 2 is much stronger than Volume 1, it is apparent that the Hal Roach Studios have become comfortable with their new sound apparatus and can now focus on producing funny comedies again.

For those looking for Spanky, he will not turn up until Volume 3.

Update 9/21/14:  Have now had this for about 10 months.  It still works very well; am using on a daily basis and have not even had to do any deep cleaning(vinegar rinse etc).  Have been very satisfied with brew results from the k cups and from the carafe.  Not as satisfied with the single cup loose grounds brew though; don't use that option very often so haven't mastered the right portion of water for the strength I want.
The only errors I have had is when I wanted to brew a single cup but left the selector on the carafe setting.  That's ok thought as long as the carafe is always left in place because the single cup will just come out into the carafe. If you do not leave the carafe in place all the time though you would have a cup of coffee pouring onto the counter. If you do the opposite though and leave the selector on the single cup setting when you want to brew a carafe, it will not cause a problem because the machine just gives an error message and doesn't let the water come through - very clever, almost foolproof design."

I've had no problems with this being broken. My grandson is almost 3 and loves to play with it. It's very well made and really fun. I would recommend this to anyone. My son loves this set and the only thing I don't like is that it's made of cardboard and it's very hard to assemble. It's hard to put together and it's not going to stay together for long. I've bought several other sets and this one was the first one I bought. The colors are a little off but it's perfect. It is well made and it's very well made.

He sets off alone, searching for his own identity in hopes of proving what he is to himself. He searches for Callandor, the Sword That Is Not a Sword, the Sword That Cannot Be Touched. No hand but the true Dragon Reborn can break its wards and draw it.
But, as with everything, it is not that simple. There is always a challenge and it is a battle to the finish that threatens to send him over the edge of sanity.
Robert Jordan continues his tale with the third installment of The Wheel of Time, better still than the Great Hunt.
With four dimensional characters, a vivid vision and the most complicated plot of any story, Jordan transcends the fantastic, discovering a tale truer than any text book, a story for all stories, a legend for all time."

787,-1,Movies_and_TV_5,1,"If you've watched director David DeCoteau's previous movies (The Brotherhood series, The Frightening, Leeches), then you pretty much know what to expect:

1) buff young studs running around in their underwear for no apparent reason

2) slomo sequences that are so dull and repetitious, and used mainly to add minutes to the movie;

3) plots with holes the size of the Grand Canyon;

4) lots of bad acting;

5) awful music of any genre.

SPEED DEMON is no exception, although this is one of his less entertaining films.  The others at least had some modicum of suspense and/or horror.  This movie has no suspense, no horror, no real gore, no sex scenes (unless you count the numerous times the boys spread some kind of blood all over their buff chests.  DeCoteau is obviously a director who caters to his alternative lifestyle audience, and while I have no real problem with this, he should at least make the movie a lot more interesting than this dull dud.  The identity of the speed demon is so hilarious, it defies belief."

797,-1,Books_5,1,"I've never read a book that so completely makes a mountain out
of a molehill of non-existent ""evidence."" This book requires
dozens of traitors to be involved(Marshall, Stark, etc. etc.), unless Stinnet thinks FDR
was intercepting and decoding those msgs by his fireside using a English-Japanese dictionary and a copy of the Japanese codes.
The evidence is absolutely overwhelming  and incontrovertible , both from participants as well as Japanese witnesses interviewed
after the war that the author of this book is out to lunch, and trying to make a quick buck with a lurid tale. Even the logic of
allowing the US fleet to be caught unaware makes no sense whatsoever - if the Japanese bomb Pearl arbor, whether it's ready or not, that means war. FDR would have gained absolutely nothing by allowing the attack to succeed. It also could have been far worse had the attack destroyed the fuel farms, which they would have except for Nagumo's trepidation. And that would have put the Pacific Fleet back on the West Coast and immobile for a year. Nor was their any reason to believe that Hitler would declare war on the US as a result, as claimed. The Japanese didn't go to war with Russia (which Hitler strongly wished) just because Japan's partner Germany had. So how is war with Japan going to result in a war with Germany? It depended on Hitler, who had no good reason to declare war on the US. He was stupid to have done so."
798,-1,Books_5,5,"This is an evaluation, in part,  of the negative aspects that all religions are capable of, and indeed prone to committing towards humanity.  The historical records of Christianity, Judaism and Islam are not as unblemished as their proponents would  have us believe..
The author directs his rhetoric towards a Christian individual, seemingly because, as he points out, Christianity has been unquestionably responsible for more bloodshed throughout the ages than any other  religion.  The author points out that morality is quite possible without the fear of God, and to a great  extent, nations  fare better with a lesser involvement
in religious matters..  Statics show  relations between degree of religious adherence and crime, infant mortality, educational performance of its children and several other indices.  The skeptics come out on top in all sociological matters..Doesn't it seem outlandish that in order to run for a political office in the United States, one must profess a deep religious sentiment,.. ..truthful or not?  A person of sterling qualities, honest, caring for his fellow human being, moral in every way, does not stand a chance if he would claim to be an atheist. Something is terribly wrong with this. We could take a lesson from Western Europe, where religious practice is at a bare minimum,, but their kids do better in school than our kids do, they live longer than we do, and more newborns make it to adulthood than ours do.
This book must be read in a calm and sober way.  The author is not attacking the religious individual;  just questioning the true validity of all these man made concepts and gods."

You can not help but to feel for Diana, wishing that she would get better.  Gideon was an amazing character even with all of his own demons he fought the hardest for Diana.

We follow Diana on her struggle to get past the fact that she was raped.  She always believed that if anything bad was about to happen that the hero would swoop in and save you.  She had a hero with her, Gideon, did what he could to save her but on that day it was not enough in the physical sense.

As Diana fights to become a person again, Gideon is there every step of the way.  Even though there are more steps back than forward it seems.  He is also trying to deal with the fact that he was unable to save her.  Although his words to her that day did save a small piece of herself, she just needs to find the rest of the pieces to be whole again.

Gideon and Dianas relationship continues to grow, helps both of them heal with the aftermath of that day.  In the end they both were each others saviors."

If you're thinking about going with this food, you should definitely read the reviews.

Also, I'm not sure if it is a product of the cats or just their natural diet. Maybe the cat is on a diet with a protein, so if that's your cat's diet, I would definitely recommend it.

An Inescapable Attraction is an engaging western romance that is set in the time period following the Civil War, but before the turn of the century. Through her descriptive writing, Sydney Jane Baily has done a superb job of bringing each character, and their surroundings to life. Her characters are not perfect, and there are moments that they are not even very likable. However, through all of Ellie and Thaddeus' trials and tribulations, both not only mature, but they each work out their differences and come to loving trust that will insure their HEA.

I really liked this book. Granted, the sexual content was descriptive, but it was not graphic. That said, I would have enjoyed it much more without the religious expletives.

I was concerned ONLY about the issue regarding the hinge but as just about every laptop has a downside I thought I'd risk it. Well I'm feeling pretty bad about this because though the price seems good for the specs a $1200 laptop is not budget and the three things I depend on every time I turn on the unit is DISPLAY, TRACKPAD AND KEYBOARD. Keyboard is a biggie for me and I give it a favourable rating. Trackpad is giving me hell. I had a great time with the synaptics software on my the lenovo I traded this in for. But the software that supports this trackpad is oversenstive. Cursor flies all over the place doing all kinds of madness while I'm typing. Constantly stopping to undo what it has done. Not a soul at ASus has replied to that query. Display was NEVER  a feature I spend alot of time on before because displays just did what displays should do but this yellow tint on the unit that so many other complain of that I didn't realise before makes my eyes hurt. I have done all I can do to calibrate but nothing really helps.

884,-1,Books_5,3,"I'd give it 3 and a half stars, if half a star was possible.  Derleth's take on Lovecraft follows a certain theme that doesn't change all that much from story to story:  thin, white, bookish, guy inherits spooky old house by some half-forgotten relative/friend; weird stuff happens that he can't explain; bookish guy inevitably does research in old tomes at Arkham; and the story ends in a paragraph of italics that's supposed to fill you with a sense of horror.  The sense of spookiness that permeated throughout Lovecraft's stories is absent, replaced by an extremely predictable italicized ending.  I have to agree with the reader from San Francisco, the Good gods versus the Bad gods was not a great idea.  Of course it doesn't really matter, since a few gods are merely mentioned in passing when the bookish guy does research at Miskatonic.  Derleth seems to prefer Lovecraft's theme of evil rednecks in the backwoods of Massachusetts rather than promoting anything in the Cthulu mythos.  All in all, stay far far away from this book if you've never read Lovecraft, and if you have read him than you don't really need to be in a hurry to pick this one up."

When I received an offer to try these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I expected them to be like all the other gloves I bought in the past.

The majority of the glove is made from a very soft leather, that looks like it will last for a long time.  the non contact part of the gloves is a really high quality mesh material that keeps the gloves breathable.  The gloves are half finger, which I like, as feeling the weights keeps me in control of them.

Based on other reviews, I did go a size up, and they fit me very well.  They are also very versatile, as I can use them for biking as well as in the gym.  I find them to be very comfortable, and I tend to forget I even have them on!

I have two pairs of Merrell Women's Moab Mid Waterproof Hiking Boots, and I still wear both of them. The first pair, I ordered a year ago, and though I'm out in them every day, the tread still looks brand new.

They are very reliable, even out in the rain. My first pair only lost it's ""waterproof"" viability when I had to walk in two feet of water on a hike. And I'm sure they probably could be sprayed with waterproofing spray to get them back into shape; I just haven't done it yet. If you know you're going to be out in a constant torrential downpour, rain boots are more appropriate, but these should keep you dry unless you're walking in water.

I mentioned that I have pronation, and this can make me very prone to spraining my ankle. These boots have a good mid-height that keep my ankles secure, but they're not so stiff that they cause chafing. You'll find when you first get them that they're only a little stiff, and one or two walks will probably be enough to break them in.

Both my pairs are a half-size larger, and I did this based on other reviews. I highly recommend this as well, as I find that if I'm wearing bulky socks, they can rub a little on my outer toes even at a half-size larger.

They're very comfortable. Not exactly walking on clouds, but your feet are definitely are not going to hurt after five or six hours on the trails. I wear Doc Martens to work (office work, but I'll never wear heels), and when I slip the Merrells on, they do feel like slippers.

I have worn several other waterproof day-type boots (leading brands), and I lost treads and the boots fell apart quickly. These are definitely for the long haul and worth every penny."

916,-1,Toys_and_Games_5,4,"I would actually give mine a glowing review had it not been for one stiff wrist joint, hand broke off leaving the peg in the slot. His ankles were fine and his paint job was good, so I'm all the more annoyed at myself (I even thought ""Gee, it would suck if I broke the wrist and got the peg stuck in the slot ...""). Aesthetically speaking, it's quite good, though they over did it a bit with the top-heavy look, true, they were pretty barrel chested with tiny legs on the show, but this is just slightly more exaggerated, it's not a deal breaker at all though. While articulated enough to get a fairly wide range of poses, it's still hampered a bit because the range of the joints is limited a bit by the bulk of the figure, only to a small degree however. The only real ""flaw"" I felt there was with it in its own right was the lack of a swivel joint at the hips (a two way ankle join would also have fixed this). The stand is a bit of a joke, though it serves its purpose. Due to the width of his waist it doesn't actually hold him, but it works enough to prop him up with the cape draping over it.

Finally, when I broke the wrist I stopped caring and yoinked the head off (I was afraid before there was some other trick ad pulling the head off was requiring no small amount of effort, so ""I didn't want to break it""), that is definitely how it's meant to be done, it's a thick rubber-y plastic on a ball and socket joint (though you only get left/right movement), so I hope that clears up some head scratching."

I also wanted something relatively small, due to limited desktop space, and these certainly are---the other speakers certainly weren't huge, but these really do give me some extra space.

Plug it into the input jack, plug the normal size power cord into an outlet, and you're good to go.

This cheap, thin, tin-like metal has no substance to it at all; its tantamount to a polished tin can. The 'anti spill' ring (atop the bowl) is too large for small breeds such as my 20 pound Shih-Tzu.  It arrived with the rubber, anti-slide/anti-skid, gasket detached, it falls off very easily and is nearly impossible to replace without stretching it, which totally defeats its purpose, in that it falls off almost every time you pick it up.

There is a hollow space under the anti spill, upper rim, that is impossible to keep clean.  Having no instructions, enclosed, who could possibly know that upper anti spill rim is designed to come off?  Good luck managing that feat and be careful not to pinch your skin both wrestling it off and getting it back on.  Having shopped finer boating and camping stores, I found this is a really bad knock off of the ones I have found since.

My really good dog food bowls are stainless steel, incredibly heavy and have lasted 3 lifetimes (dog lives) they cost a small fortune when I bought them 20 years ago, but were more than worth it.  I was looking for comparable water bowls when giving this a try; and it is not even close to being close.

Unless you only need this for the boat or camper for a week or two and a few weekends a year...  Do yourself a favor and buy heavy duty, stainless steel and don't have names put on (unless removable).  Spend the money once and never again.

1008,-1,Electronics_5,5,"***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.

**UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**

This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.

Cons:
- Will not straighten out, not at all, it strongly insists on remaining curly, which makes it far less inconspicuous as it refuses to lie and kinks up
- Pinches your fingers badly, really, really badly.  Seems impossible, I know, but seriously, it hurts.  The plastic they used is just wrong for this application, it's so stiff it I'm typing this on fingers that are raw from having to spread it open to put the cables inside.
- It is NOT white, it's an off white, so it doesn't blend in as well with real white as it should.

Pros:
- Umm, there seem very few alternative products... so I guess mere existence is a pro."

1023,-1,Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,"When it comes to golf, I have been a beginner for the last 25 years or so. I've always lived within a couple of miles of one golf course or another, and so it seems that it's the natural order of things that I'll get invited to play at least once a year. Here lies my predicament. I don't play enough to drop serious golfer cash on a set, but over the years I've grown tired of having to borrow a set or rent the bowling shoe equivalent of a set of clubs on those infrequent occasions. It seems my solution has been found in this Callaway Strata Plus set.

There is no denying that this set is a starter set. But I think that anyone who has had experience with starter sets would agree that this is a pretty high quality starter set, considering the retail price point. The clubs are sturdy, and, at 6'1"", I didn't find myself hunched over, as I have in the past with other inexpensive sets. This set also includes every club a beginner to casual golfer would need to get through a round of golf.

It might sound a little ridiculous, but the bag itself actually adds quite a bit to the value of this set in my book. A common problem with starter sets that I've tried to manage in the past is that the bags would be so cheaply made that they seemed to begin to dissolve prior to the back nine. The Strata bag is not super high quality, but its quality enough considering the price point. It is easy to carry and includes a stand (the one dead giveaway of the guy who never golfs is the bag laying beside him on its side emptying all its contents every time he stops to take a shot).

I know this set is not going to be turning any heads or impressing anyone who is a regular golfer, but it's better than the dreaded rental set, and certainly meets the needs of an intermittent golfer without sacrificing the kids' college fund."

1031,-1,Movies_and_TV_5,5,"Today, almost everyone has heard of Billy Graham, but not everybody knows his early history--or ""the rest of the story"", as Paul Harvey liked to say.  This DVD tells the rest of that story, and it was very interesting.

The narrative begins with Billy Graham as a young man living at his parent's home, and how he came to be called into the ministry.  We also learn about the person he almost married, and the one he did--and how he met her.  We see how one of Billy Graham's very best friends in the ministry lets him down, and then ridicules him publicly.  It is very easy to identify with Billy Graham in the different situations portrayed.

This movie definitely keeps your interest, some parts are funny and some are sad.  Even if Billy Graham were not a public figure, this would be an account worth watching.  Even though there were not any big name actors in this film, it was well done and enjoyable.  I am a long-time admirer of Dr. Graham, and came forward at one of his crusades when I was twelve years old.  Learning Dr. Graham's history made me respect him even more.

The movie is suitable for all ages and clean.  Our family highly recommends this, and gives it five stars."

However, the biggest negative for me, and one of the reasons I don't use it much, is because it tangles up so easily. The reflective tape they have woven into the rope makes it tangle even easier than it normally would without the reflective material. But for $12, I'm not going to complain too much."

1046,-1,Kindle_Store_5,4,"This is book 5 in the Montana Born Brides series. The books in the series all take place in Marietta and the pending celebrity wedding of a local girl gone big time links them together. The neat fact is that the books in this series are written by different authors. I enjoyed Magdalena and Jake's story. We saw them both in previous books and we knew that Magdalena had returned home with her teenage daughter after being gone since she became pregnant as a teenager. She has been the topic of small town gossip because she has never revealed the name of her daughter's father. Jake is a famous country singer who is taking a break because he's lost his muse and is unable to write any new music. Although famous, Jake is down to earth and likable. Im not always a fan of love at first sight, but Jakes feelings for Magdalena are sincere and based upon not only her looks but her singing. This was a good book and a nice addition to the series.

1052,-1,Pet_Supplies_5,5,"Bottom Line - Convenient, lightweight, small, and most importantly SAFE for your pup.  Dog harness crash testing has a long way to go, and most products don't truly protect your dog from getting injured or injuring others during a crash.  This Sleepypod system is one of the few that is proven to work well.  You won't regret this purchase, and your canine friend will thank you for it.

Pros
-Tested and proven.  This is the most important criteria for me, and it was a must in my purchase of any vehicle harness.
-Does not require you to latch into the baby seat hooks.  It's as simple as stringing the seatbelt through the hoops.
-Lightweight and small enough to be utilized as a regular walking harness *for short walks.*  For instance, if I am making a quick run to my home department store and I want to take the dog, this Clickit can serve as a vehicle safety harness and a walking harness all in one.  I would not recommend it for long walks, running, or hikes, however, as it isn't nearly as nimble, lightweight, and breathable as other dedicated sport harnesses (and it isn't supposed to be).

Cons
-The leash clips don't have enough slack, so it's a little more difficult than it needs to be to clip a leash onto both D-rings.  Not impossible, but just more difficult than it needs to be.
-The adjustability is not quite where I would like it to be.  My dog has an interesting shape with a relatively large chest with a small neck.  We had to buy the medium due to her chest size and weight, but the neck adjustment is ever-so-slightly too large even when adjusted as tight as it can be."

Lowpoints: Too much zombies, too little subliminal terror at times; Megan Burns as the little girl is a truly terrible performance that fortuitously doesn't bring the film down.
Conclusion: An unflinching, metaphorical look at the possible loss of control over rage amongst humans, 28 Days Later marks Danny Boyle's comeback from his flop The Beach. Petrifying with its realism and astounding in its contrastive moods, 28 Days Later definitely has more in common with the director's dark masterpiece Trainspotting - it is scary, droll and compelling, and will linger with its audience, despite its flaws, long after the ending.

1066,-1,Books_5,4,"The why gives you charisma; the why gives you strength, purpose, and direction; the why separates you from the flock. This idea is undeniably powerful and deserves widespread attention.

Sinek gets to the heart of success by showing the importance of having a higher purpose, or why, behind everything you do. The 200+ pages of the book are elaborations on this single idea. Some might find that length repetitive or overdone, and at times it is; but overall, I found the length helpful in exploring the power and ramifications of the idea.

Considering the fundamental why helps any organization discover its authentic identity, make all decisions on the basis of that authenticity, and project an authentic image to the public. When you have a solid, authentic core, Sinek suggests, decisions are easier and buyers are more attracted to you because you have conviction and you're serving the world for a greater purpose other than merely selling widgets like everyone else.

Starting with why doesn't apply only to business. It applies everywhere, to every project you're working on. It applies to your identity and your life's work. If you think about it, even the greatest artists are those who have had compelling ""why""s.

Alternate titles for the book could be ""The Way of Why"" or, after Eckhart Tolle, ""The Power of Why."" Start with Why is a quick read, yet powerful enough to change your outlook on marketing and persuasion, powerful enough to help you become a more focused and productive person and to help you live a more meaningful life.

The only question: WHY haven't you read it?"

1069,-1,Pet_Supplies_5,5,"Just purchased this cat tree a week ago. It arrived quickly and was better than I imagined. The cat houses were large enough for my adult cats. I was worried they might be a little small, but they were spacious enough for one cat to fit in a house at a time and roll around or hide in it. This is my cats first cat tree condo and it won't be their last.

When I purchased this cat tree I saw that there were similar trees for less money, but I chose this one by Armarkat because the reviews said it was sturdy. I must admit this cat tree was easy to put together and it is extremely sturdy. My cats jump on and off and climb it without any wobbling. I have two cats and both are about 13 lbs. The carpet material is a little on the cheapy side, but the cats enjoy it so I can't complain. I purchased the Kong catnip and sprinled some on the cat tree and my cats are in heaven and happy to be up off of the ground. I purchased the 74"" tree and was concerned it might not be tall enough to make the cats feel secure, but it's plenty tall and spacious too!

If you are looking for a sturdy tree that your cat/s will enjoy I recommend this product by Armarkat."

1075,-1,Pet_Supplies_5,5,"I like this product as it works better on dog toenails than toenail clippers.  I just received the product today and ordered it b/c a neighbor who owns a larger Bully type dog uses the Dremel on his dog's toenails rather than toenail clippers.  The Dremel is easy to use and the instructions are clear and concise.  The dog (98 lb Labrador) was very calm while I sanded his toenails usually he fights me all the way when using toenail clippers.  The only drawback to this product is that the battery life isn't very long.  I was able to complete two paws or 8 toenails and 2 dewclaws before the battery ran down.  The charger plugs directly into an electrical socket and the battery is easily removed from the Dremel.  The Dremel is easy to hold in your hand and maneuverable so I like that attribute.  I would suggest wearing goggles or glasses and a carbon mask due to the amount of dust produced and get a grittier sandpaper if your dogs toenails are very long or over 1/4"" thick.  I noticed that they do sell Mandrels, drums and other types of attachments for the Dremel and different gradations of sandpaper etc.  This product is much better than that battery run ""As Seen On TV"" thing that I purchased, used one time and threw in the trash."

Kurklops has a body squeaker and one at the tip of each tentacle. Max ripped the squeakers out of each tentacle before working on the body. What is nice is that each limb is a separate stitched compartment so that by ripping out the stuffing in one part of the toy, he isn't able to take out all the stuffing in one shot.

I was privileged to personally see a Fonteyn & Nureyev performance with the Royal Ballet, one of their last, of ""Marguerite & Armand"" at the Met in NY, and she was an aspiring young dancer's dream - beautiful, graceful, classic with perfect form, and what EMOTION; she was the only ballerina I ever saw who put her whole heart and soul into the character, and owned it.  It is wonderful that some of this talent is preserved in films like ""Evening with the Royal Ballet"" and also Czinner's ""Royal Ballet,"" both of which feature Fonteyn in select acts of famous ballets.  I have also recently purchased the Fonteyn biography by Meredith Daneman which was interesting but mostly speculation; if you really want to learn about Fonteyn, her art always came first, and it is much better to snap up as many performance DVDs or tapes as you can find like this one, to have a true understanding of this amazing prima ballerina assoluta and why she was so beloved."

As the bolts are all carriage bolts, no screwdriver or other wrenches are required.  Once assembled, the unit attaches to the ladder with a pair of locking pins.  At first glance the assembled products doesn't seem like it would fit as securely as I'd like.  However, I attached it to a 32' Louisville type IA ladder and it actually fits very securely.  Upon lifting the ladder to a height of about 22' and leaning it against the shingles on my roof, I found the product to be very secure and the ladder very stable.

1135,-1,Electronics_5,4,"Overall this TV has an awesome picture.  White is bright brilliant white, and it almost looks like a samsung panel due to its glossy look, just instead of samsung logo you see TCL.  This TV was 429, does 1080p and has tons of hook ups.  More than most people will need.  I also own a 55"" LED Sony TV, and I dare say picture quality is barely below the sony, and may look better on cable, due to the compression used, and the fact it doesnt need to strech the compressed image another 15 inches.

My only complaint for all TCL TV's at this time, is the lack of universal remotes being able to control them.  I have a 2 TCL TV's right now (the 32 inch and 40 inch) and my Comcast DVR remote cannot control them.  Their is no code in the manual for TCL at all, and when you use the ""Search for code"" feature, i went through it about 200 times, and could not get it to shut the TV off.  I have also read may posts about people having this same issue.  As best as I can tell at this time there are only 2 remotes confirmed to work with these TV's 1 being a 29 dollar logitech and the other being a Sony universal remote for about 15 bucks.  Thats why I knocked off 1 star.

Other than that so far this TV has been great, gives good picture quality, and OK sound from a normal TV setup.  Definately a great bedroom TV for Videogames, TV, Movies, etc.  Could even be used as a living room tv depending on the circumstances."

Her plots are complicated just to be complicated and some of her ""good"" characters are unlovably sticky.  Her insistence on the occasional arcane vocabulary seems arbitrary and pettifogging -- especially since perfectly good modern English words are available for most of them.  (After all, her dialogue is actually a ""translation"" of the Chaucerian language they spoke in, anyway.)  Nevertheless, Robb is a good writer and constructor and the book is a romp to read.  Better start the soap opera here, by the way -- she won't catch you up later in the series if you miss an episode."

Jagger comes from not so great of a childhood and Tatiana comes from a childhood of abuse, so they have something in common which is the crappy childhoods. And of course, it's what brings them together which is maybe what I found so cliche.

1167,-1,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,"This is the fourth Skagen watch I've owned.  It's my favorite so far, but all of them have been great. The first is still working, but is looking a little worn, due to my having worn it as a ""barn"" watch whil working with my horses, and also during various other outside activities.  It even survived an accidental laundering, and still worked.  The second watch was very pretty and a little more stylish, but developed a problem with coming unlatched--lost it while shopping, and I imagine someone found themselves a nice watch. The third watch is still nice, with the exception of several broken strands of metal on the band.  I will probably have the band replaced and use it as a back up, since it still works fine.  The only other thing any of these has ever required is the occasional battery replacement.

As to my present watch, it's my favorite because I really like the style; it's small enough not to overwhelm my small wrist, but easy to read.  It's the typical, practical Skagen stainless steel, but polished enough to be dressy.  The gold tone numbers make it more versatile, as it blends well with gold tone jewelry.  The band seems to be a little heavier quality than the other watches, and was much easier to adjust the length. The only problem I can speak of, and it's a very minor one, is that the stem is a little stiff and it was hard to turn when setting the time.  This shouldn't be an issue after the initial set up, so it doesn't detract from my rating this watch excellent."

The little black clips slide around and make it hard for gameplay, as most of us don't remember how many points we have on the cards. One member of our group used some pieces of note card to pad under the clips, it helped if you don't feel like replacing the parts.
It's a good game to play with 6 people, although it does take seemingly forever to get to your turn again (i was always the last player to go, so it didn't help).
I wish i wasn't a visual learner sometimes, because when people read off their cards it's a bit hard to follow, but i just asked for the card to be passed around the group if there was nothing ""secret"" on it.
With six people playing it can take 3 hours of playtime, depending on how the game goes. We got this for our D&D group for when some players cannot show up but we still want to play something.

1187,-1,Kindle_Store_5,3,"I didn't have very high expectations for this book. The combination of teen romance and historical fiction made me nervous that I would be cringing the whole way through. Fortunately, the author did her research and the result is a fairly accurate portrayal of life in a convent in Renaissance Italy, with a splash of magical realism. The romance elements don't really kick in until the halfway mark, leaving most of the book to focus on other aspects of the protagonist's life, what romance there is isn't overbearing or unrealistic. A plot twist 3/4 through helps keep things fresh with an unexpected change of setting for the final act. The book is largely well-written, but there are some poor descriptive techniques scattered about (""as cold as January"" was a particularly bland simile that stuck in my mind).

Where the book disappoints is in the drama. Most elements of the plot had me wondering why these characters care even half as much as they apparently do. The protagonist is a 17-year-old illegitimate daughter of a recently-deceased nobleman who's been sent by her step-mother to live in a convent. This is problematic for our hero because the only thing she wants on this world is to find a man to marry. A more charitable reviewer would say that she's realistically very focused given the options for those in her situation, but her one-track-mind struck me as obsessive and overly dramatic. The aforementioned plot twist is fairly transparent (if you're expecting a twist), and the while the MacGuffin around which the twist is centered may be historically accurate in terms of its importance, it seemed fairly trivial to me and fed into the overall feeling of unnecessary drama.

The protagonist's personal conflicts are sure to resonate with many readers, particularly girls around her age and younger. Readers who have an interest in art, particularly painting, might understand the drama better, and will definitely appreciate the author's descriptions of the art and architecture. The ending could be interpreted as slightly preachy, but it doesn't detract from the book."

Streep covers her own experiences from young girlhood to adulthood. She backs up her position with plenty of research, and testimonies from other women. Although her writing weaves from one person to another and one time period to another, it flows quite well.

I praise streep for this book. I think anyone who felt unloved as a child ( and still as an adult ) will appreciate this. Because the phenomenom of unloving mothers is so largely hidden,it has taken a while for people to recognise it. Streep is one of the brave pioneers who, in recent years, has tackled this topic. My hope is to use this knowledge and not repeat the cycle with my own daughter. Also recommended: The Art of Quitting. Only halfway through but very good!"

1217,-1,Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,"I really liked this knife when I first got it.  Pro:  It was my first spring assisted blade and I really enjoyed it.  Fast to open, with practice you can operate with only one hand (open and close), I like the feel in the hand and in the pocket with the provided clip, and I like the construction of the handle.  Very sturdy and has good texture to keep it secure in the hand.

Con:  Steel did not keep much of an edge.  Too much of the edge is wasted on serration (I know this is easily discernible from the picture but in the field I only used the serrated section once.  Usually it just got in the way).  Too much play in the blade.  Others have mentioned this in their reviews.  But even after tightened there was a little play and it seemed to get loose pretty easily.  But the thing that really bothered me is that the spring (as in the one that assists in opening) broke.  And since that happened, the lock does not stay engaged either (I assume that they are connected).  So now this thing is going in the trash.  The blade literally just flops back and fourth.  I do not even trust it to use as a tool in the always open position because the lock is unreliable.  Long story short, save your money, and buy a better knife.  I thought Gerber was good quality.  At least they seemed to be when I was growing up.  But I will probably not own another one.  Life expectancy should be more than a year an a half.  EDC tools should be more reliable.  My EDC of choice now is a Spyderco Endura 4 Wave that I also bought from Amazon.  Will post a detailed review of that soon."

I was never able to escape into the story; the writing, gorgeous as it was, always kept me at arm's length, reminding me that I was reading, well, gorgeous writing. (The plot was pretty predictable too; how many ""virus-ends-the-world"" narratives do we need?) This is not a criticism of the author's abilities, but I personally enjoy novels that are a bit less polished, novels that allow me to forget the craft and lose myself in the story. It's a fine line, I'll admit--too little craft calls attention to itself as surely as too much. But there is a balance, and for me, this novel didn't achieve it."

Both pretending to be someone that they're not, neither Cass nor Logan was looking for more than a fun night, with no strings, then they'd go their separate ways. Funny how things never go as planned.

Fast forward two years. Cass is an independent successful woman, striving to be taken seriously in a field dominated by men. Life has not turned out exactly as she'd expected, but she is smart and secure enough in herself and her goals to roll with the changes that life has thrown her way. Finding herself a single mom, she has more than risen to the occasion, and is raising Olivia with the love that she never experienced in her own childhood.

While Logan has spent the last two years dedicated to his job, he hasn't ever forgotten that night with Cass. When the two meet again, it's like the sexual tension has been simmering under the surface, and like they haven't been apart at all. Finding out that Cass (or Miss Mary, as he calls her; seriously sexy!) and he have a daughter rocks his world. Even though he is angry that she's kept Olivia from him (or so he thinks), he can't fight the attraction for Cass that's still as strong as ever.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book. There is humor, intrigue (it's a spy story, after all!), passion, and so much love.

The sightmarks action to move it out of the way felt cheap and was not very fluid.  The Vortex went on sale for 159 which was a bargain.  The VMX-3T flips out of the way with a simple button movement.  Can easily be done on the fly one handed.  I like the way it feels.  The magnifier is very clear and works great when paired with a Eotech 512.  It comes with a hight spacer so that you can raise it a smidge if it is to low.  You can fully adjust where it is pointed through the side and top adjustments (like any scope).

The one down side which I find on all scopes if your eye is not at the right distance it shrinks the field of view.  I did not find this to bad in shooting with it though.

I have not used there warranty service but it covers everything except theft and intentional damage for the lifetime of the product.

I bought 2 additional ones to the one I already had at the sale price."

1285,-1,Kindle_Store_5,5,"Caroline Andrews and Josh Summers were the match that I was looking for in this series. They had different reasons for needing a second shot. Love was not the only reason to need a second chance at something important. Their encountered began with the previous books of the series. Through their secondary interactions with the other leads made for a pleasurable journey for the two of them to finally make that step to creating a relationship in Forever, OR. Josh had experienced loss, confusion, and the desire to want what was once his. He knew this look when he saw it on the face of Caroline. There was this draw to Caroline that he could not deny. Finally getting that chance to make things more was the opportunity that he was looking for. Josh captivated me back a few book and the sweetness continues on. The sense of humor was on point and charming. He was all the dream qualities one wants in a man strong, sweet, patient, kind, and protective. His knack for baking pies makes him well liked. It also provides a connection for him and Caroline. I found Josh to my favorite Second Shot hero. He has my heart. Caroline was truly a match for him. Thank you Sara. Where are we heading next?

1335,-1,Electronics_5,4,"I'm commenting here only about a belated experience to remark about the resiliency of this unit to water. In an attempt to move my jacket out of the way in boarding a kayak in fresh water (Rainbow River, Fl), one of the pockets of the gore-tex jacket accidentally hung out of the craft (unbeknowngs to me) when my partner sitting behind me said ""one of your pockets is in the water"". Yep, it had the Canon camera in it; it had been submerged inside the pocket for about a full minute (perhaps longer), but the pocket hadn't pooled with water, only was wet inside. Needless to say, it appeared to be a goner. The viewfinder had beads of water inside, and the screen inside showed condensation and water droplets. Also, the battery compartment had some water in it, but not pooled, but enough that I could pour out several drops from it. I removed the batteries, and over a period of about 60 hours, exposed the camera to sunlight on the dashboard and inside the glove compartment to dry out. It gradually dissapated the droplets inside the viewfinder, and the condensation from the inside screen disappeared. Only at that time did I attempt to turn it on. I couldn't believe it! The 4GB SD card was intact with the pics, and the motor successfully retracted the lens. A few trial pics confirmed that the camera is now back in working order. Call it luck, but patience prevailed in letting natural sunlight and warmth bring it back to life. I'm impressed with this experience."

I was thrilled to see this item available because I loved the mystery activity books in my youth that would come with the special pen that uncovered the hidden messages.

He liked the red magnifying glass that revealed secret symbols to help him with the activities and the decoder pens.
The product is well packaged and  intriguing for kids to want to pick up to open (which is common with most Melissa and Doug products).
The age range for this toy is probably 7+. I'm disappointed as a parent because my child has not shown additional interest since the first day of opening this product. As I mentioned, I think it's a good concept at a good price point, but not sure if it's worth an hour of entertainment."

Since I installed this about 6 months ago, I have never had to clean any calcium from my dishwasher wands.  Yes, I changed out my dishwasher when I installed the Eddy but I really believe I have seen a difference.  I had decided I would spend my budget on the Eddy rather than a top of the line dishwasher since they all seem to clog with the hard water in my area (200 mg/L as CaCO3 or 12 grains).

1394,-1,Books_5,3,"My theory is fiction writers (especially regarding their first novel) is analogous to my theory on psychiatrists.  Every psychiatrist I know has gone into the profession to learn more about their own particular psychosis.  Likewise, every author writes his first novel to exorcise his secret fantasies.  If this is indeed the case, Schickler is one messed up dude.

Each story is about a character's search for a lover and ultimately acceptance the taciturn landscape of a Manhattan apartment building - the Preemption.  We are introduced to each character in terms of their principal personal flaw, be it physical or emotional.  (What is Schickler's own personal flaw?  Perhaps he had both an unsightly birthmark and total insecurity about a childhood loss).  Each of these flaws is at the core of Schickler's stories.  The stories focus on the pursuit of the opposite sex.  We eavesdrop on each characters fantasies and insecurities.  (I think Schickler must secretly desire to order a gorgeous travel writer into his jalopy).  One thing is for certain, Schickler idolizes beautiful women.  Every woman in the book is gorgeous and lubricious.  The most developed character (and thus - according to my theory - the character most closely resembling Schickler) is a stock trader with deviant sexual practices that I won't reveal (suffice to say Schicker's dates had better be suspicious of nice diners).

In the end, Kissing in Manhattan is clearly Schickler's own little personal fantasy with names changed to protect the innocent.  It's a book about losers scoring the knockout babe, about dazzling women allowing themselves to be dominated by eccentric men, and ultimately about ONE man's quest to find sexual satisfaction and acceptance of his personal shortcomings.  That man's name is David Schickler."

1402,-1,Movies_and_TV_5,4,"Michael Weiss and the other creators of this redux of the Jules Verne classic posit that someone who actually made the trip to the center of the earth through a volcanic tube told the story to Verne. In short, Trevor Anderson (Fraser) is a struggling geologist who has been trying for ten years to prove his brother Max's theory that the Jules Verne tale is real.  Trevor's inherited project is about to be closed down when his sister in law brings his 13-year-old nephew, Sean, (Hutcherson) to stay for a couple of days.

Along with Sean's baggage is a box of Max's things, including his hand-annotated version of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" Based on Max's notes, Trevor realizes that his brother actually was close to proving his theories before he disappeared. Coincidentally, the geological conditions are perfectly matched to those under which Max died.

This brings Trevor and Sean to Iceland, where Max was last seen.  They hire mountain guide, Hannah (Briem),  who was also the daughter of another Vernian, to take them up the mountain to one of Max's monitoring sites.

Through a freak accident, they end up falling through a cave down into the center of the earth.  Thus, their journey to return begins.  You will see elements of the threats from the original novel--in 3D if your theatre supports it.  Much of the film is a wild ride with vestiges of ""Temple of Doom"" style mine shafts and water slides that will leave you gasping.

The 3D effects are pretty stunning, which is probably the best part of the film with a few touching scenes included between Trevor and Sean.  Overall, seeing the remake was a satisfying experience intensified by the special effects.

Note:  Due to 3D, my theatre had a surcharge for the glasses which made the matinee price of the film close to $[...].

Warning:  Those with vertigo, migraines, seizures or other motion-triggered illnesses might want to use caution in seeing this film.

1403,-1,Books_5,3,"""Destroyer Angel"" made me sad. It's not only the violent, depressing story, but also the fact that this may be the last Anna Pigeon novel I read. I have been reading Nevada Barr's books for many years now and have been disappointed in the dark turn this series has taken. I absolutely loved the earlier books in this series, which could never be accused of being ""cozies"", but included wonderful descriptions of National Parks and a variety of realistic characters. I thought the premise of this story being a story of survival sounded intriguing, so I gave it a try. After finishing the book, I can say I liked it better than recent installments such as ""The Rope"", but didn't like it nearly as well as earlier books in this series.

I liked the vivid characterizations of the female characters and descriptions of the setting, but the male villains are interchangeable and their actions are appalling. Having the story told from different points of view added some interest, but also added redundancy and slowed the pace of the book. Some may enjoy this as a story of good vs. evil, but it's not my kind of story and even the great character of Anna Pigeon couldn't save it for me. The author has obviously chosen to take this series in a new direction, so it looks like we may be parting ways."

This is a great standalone story and book three in the series.  Book One introduced the concept of two worlds post war, divided by hidden portals. Cascadia is a world without technology or motorized vehicles and it citizens have paranormal abilities the Pacificans covet. For years the Pacifican Army has created crime waves they attribute to the Cascadians, giving them the reason they need for sustaining funding and support to continue their troop numbers.  They also seek out descendents of Cascadians living in Pacifica who have paranormal abilities and force them into the army. Those who refuse are incarcerated.  The more promising of these Talents are sent to a research lab, The Institute.  That is where Vince Crawford has been held for the past ten years, refusing to give up information about a portal he discovered that led him to Cascadia and Zara Kane, the girl he fell in love with.

Zara had just told Vince she was pregnant when he disappeared. Thinking he abandoned her, she is shocked to learn he has been imprisoned the whole time. Fiercely determined to free him, she convinces her brother to help and uses her cloaking Talent to get Vince away from his work detail and to a safe house. But neither of the lovers are the same people they were before Vince was taken. Their resulting story is one of bravery, love and patience in the face of Vince's PTSD and the force of the Pacifican Army intent on recapturing their most valuable prisoner."

LED's are more expensive on the front end, but the decreased operating costs are supposed to pay for these lights over time. Another factoid that most people do not realize is that the newer ceiling fans with lights will NOT take any bulb over 60w. If you have a three light fan, then that is 180 watts total, two is 120 watts. If the light shade is anything but white the light will be dimmed accordingly. Not knowing that, we initially had two CFL's in the lamp but soon found out that the room was really dark at night. I purchased these two bulbs that are both each equivalent of 100 watt incandescent bulbs and I was surprised how bright they are. The only problem is that the light comes out of the LED bulb somewhat directional due to its design, if you look at it the light bulb design the light bounces out of the white cover on top of the bulb. For a floor lamp or a desk lamp this design would not be a  problem, but since my application requires the lamp to be inserted at a horizontal direction (instead of top to bottom as you would in a table lamp) the light tends to not diffuse through the shade as well as a CFL or an incandescent would, instead it directs the light towards the walls instead of the ceiling. I think that you will get used to the light after a while. Ideally a LED that illuminates at a 360 degree axis like a CFL or incandescent would be better.

The white light is also something to get used to. It is much brighter than the CFL's and incandescents and more appealing especially if you are a reader or have evening low-light sight problems."

1428,-1,Books_5,5,"Im always looking for a great Bible for my teen daughters, three to be exact. I want them to be able to have the ability to pick up Gods word to read and study it, but also have the access to different versions of the Bible. When I was given the opportunity to review the NKJV Teen Study Bible, I couldn't pass the opportunity up. This is a hardback copy but is also available on Kindle as well. There are a lot of great features that go along with this Bible and those features are:

We Believe: Unpacks the Apostles Creed to reveal the biblical foundation of faith
Panorama: Keeps the big picture of each book of the Bible in view
Key Indexes: Helps with in-depth Bible Study
To the Point: Reveals what the Bible says about pressing issues
Dear Jordan: Offers biblical advice for teens
Instant Access: Tells what God says to you personally
Q&A: Tests your knowledge of Bible trivia
Bible Promises: Highlights Bible Verses worth remembering
Book Introductions: Provides an overview for each book of the Bible
Complete New King James Version (NKJV) Bible Text

Overall, this is a great Bible for any teen or pre-teen. This Bible will help your teen discover so much about Gods word and help them with issues that they face today. I highly recommend for ages 10-19. ""I received this book for free. A favorable review was not required and all views expressed are my own."

The G17 is very compact and holds the full 5.56 NATO mag with a single 9mm scope.  The Glock 19 is so light and compact that I can carry it in my backpack and on my shoulder pack with a single 9mm scope.  I've shot my AR-15 with the Glock 19 with the AR-15 G17 without a problem.  It's definitely a better gun for the money.  I bought a second one for my husband and he was impressed with the quality of the gun.  It's also a good quality holster with a good grip.  I've used it for about a year and it still works perfectly.  It does not have the recoil of the Glock 19.  I can't say that I would recommend this gun to anyone.  I'm a big guy and I don't like to be able to carry a gun at all, so I ordered this one because it's a nice little gun.  It's not a high quality gun, but it's a good gun.  I bought a second one for my husband and he was impressed with the quality of the gun.  The gun is a great value and he loves the holster.

I remember reading Mine to Lose where we were introduced to Trey. After everything that happened, I was hoping that he had his own story. This did not disappoint!

Trey is hurting because the girl he wanted belonged to someone else. He throws all his attention into his work. His younger brother Jett is back and is working with him. He and Trey go to a bar and Trey ends up drinking (which he doesnt do) and spends an amazing night with a stranger. Fast forward later and Trey is trying to get this account for his company, so he has to spend a few days with the owner and basically has to prove why his company is better that the company he previously worked for. That company sends a person to represent them and come to find out, its the girl Trey had that night with, Faith. From there sparks fly and the back and forth between them as they are trying to win the account is so good! They have a love/hate relationship but the attraction is there. talk about hot!

As you get more into the story, we learn more about Faith and who she is. You just want to take the two of them and lock them up so they can get their stuff together, but there are things that prevent it. you will enjoy this story and root for Trey and Faith all the way! Do they get together after everything that's happened? You have to read it to find out. Let me just say that Trey's brother Jett, was hilarious throughout this whole book. I can't wait for him to get his story :)

1496,-1,Books_5,5,"Dickens, along with Dostoevsky, stands atop my list of novelists who could most accurately portray the subtleties of human emotion and passion.  ""Great Expectations"" is simply a masterpiece of 19th-century fiction, and is pure Dickens.  In this semi-autobiographical work (a trademark of Dickens' writings), the life of a poor young boy, Pip, is followed from his humble beginnings to his rise into the middle-class, due to the mysterious aid of an unknown benefactor.  His pursuit of Estella, a beautiful young girl raised to break the hearts of men by her jilted caretaker, Ms. Havisham, is a classic of literature that has been repeated countless times since.  The tragic, gradual break between Pip and his family (particularly the humble but caring Joe) is heartwrenching.  Pip's eventual realization of the insincerity of the middle class, and his love for Joe, brought tears to my eyes.
""Great Expectations"" is a wonderful, moving book that has been copied and satired again and again, from Mishima's ""Forbidden Colors"" to South Park.  An important and unforgettable novel!"

1502,-1,Electronics_5,2,"I've installed SmartThings in my home about a week ago and it already feels a waste of money. The original ads looked promising, but they have just one problem: little of this will work for you. The main problem of this kit is that you're very unlikely to force it doing anything useful.

THE GOOD
-Sensors and the hub look better than many other plastic junk boxes out there.
-The customer support works great. +1 star for that.
-Bundled ""things"" are very easy to connect.
-It sometimes works.

THE BAD
-The app has a decent look, but a terrible design: it's very confusing and often feels stupid.
-To make things worse the app will prompt you to buy extra stuff without being able to run a single scenario.
-Scenarios (here they're called apps) are both useless and confusing. Just need to pair a motion sensor and light? Good luck finding an easy way to do that.
-Sonos and Philips HUE support works. Only in beta. And only if you consider such (mis)behavior a ""work"".
-Bundled manual refers to the old version of the app. But who cares if it's useless anyway?

THE UGLY
-I've spent nearly 40 minutes trying to connect the hub to the app. I'm neither mentally limited nor twisted handed, but the whole process is so confusing that I'm not sure I'll be able to repeat it again.
-Good luck making the basic kit doing anything more useful than sending you an SMS when someone opens the door.

While this might have been a good introduction to home automation, SmartThings are in fact a useless trinket for a few geeks who might have fun solving all the puzzles within its clunky app."

Cyn was one of the best female leads I've read. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind, went after her dreams (even if they were bad for her), and held her own in the Alaskan wilderness. There were times where the situation was gravely serious and she would have these thoughts that made you wonder about her depth, but then you realized that if you were in her situation you'd probably want to check some things off your bucket list too. Shane was perfect. He kept Cyn safe in some pretty harsh conditions, he was able to make light of a bad situation, while also being serious when he needed to be. Cyn and Shane together were everything. They just worked. But their story isn't finished yet. I can only assume there will be a sequel. And I. Cannot."

It was a good read, but to my taste, mind you, not Elmore Leonard good.

I actually put it on the table instead of hanging it. It just too small to put it on the wall. It look awkward.

The watch made from plastic and has a lightweight.... Which it meant cheap but i like for kid room because if it fell or drop, It won't hurt my little girl. Also its a plastic for it won't shatter. This watch is simple and cute. It comes with AA battery.  Another thing i like about this watch is the number. It is large and i can see it across the room which it helps at nighttime feeding.

I use it with my Kindle Paperwhite (2014). The fit isn't perfect, as it is designed for the Fire, but it works just fine. Inside there is a tab in each of the corners to hold down the tablet. Since this isn't spec'd for the Paperwhite, it doesn't fit in those tabs, so it can slide around. But only just barely, and since it ships with a styrofoam insert (to keep its shape during shipping), I use that for extra protection and it works great. So I definitely recommend this for other Kindle Paperwhite (or equivalent-sized e-reader) owners."

The widescreen print looks very good and is in color. I mention this because when I was growing up in the 60's we had a black and white TV set and watching this DVD was the first time I saw this film in color!

Like other Warner releases there isn't any extras, but a trailer. The price is steep, but Warner does run specials, which can bring the price down between $12.00 and $14.00. If you want the film at a reasonable price, wait until they run a sale."

This particular set is in WHITE with a shiny finish featuring a vertical grooved pattern. I'm hoping the pattern will prevent denting. There is a protective clear plastic wrap encasing the set. Attached labels & Instructions are provided on how to reset the generic 000 lock code. This luggage genuinely exceeds my expectations. I first seen the Non-Prime HAUPTSTADTKOFFER Luggage set on Amazon and the 4 differences were it had a (1) matte finish, (2) Luggage front had the Company name on a silver metal plate (classy touch) & 3rd-it was priced approximately $70.00 more (or so). My main concern was the company didn't guarantee the 2 day shipping. However, this set is gorgeous, featuring expander zippers, 360 spinner wheels that keep spinning (quietly), zipper pockets/compartment on the L side & an elastic X strap securing the (R) compartment  for larger items. The handles flow easily up and down & the set is easy to maneuver, but still feels sturdy. I purchased Amazon fabric packing cubes in the same color pattern, White mesh with a Black zipper. It compresses your clothing & frees up valuable space. As I visualize the airline terminal staff tossing my luggage into the back of a transport vehicle & loading tons of luggage on the conveyer belt, I have a feeling these 3 pieces will survive the airport onslaught.

Your unique tabs, all four of them, slid into place in about three seconds, and seems like they will be totally secure in place (at least for my dog) until I should choose to pull them out for whatever reason.

I struggled with my existing protector from Kurgo.  The tabs just did not want to slide all the way down and STAY down on my new 2018 Lincoln MKX.  I didn't have much of a problem with my previous vehicle (2013 Ford Taurus), but on my new car, they just didn't fit.  Plus, there was a big ""flap"" that stuck up along the window, making it rather unsightly.  The K&H product is literally flush with the top of the door.

Here is a remark made by Ben Jackson, a professor of a professor at Stanford: Religious Studies at Stanford University put it:
""Is this a sad tale? Well, it is sad in the same way that life is sad. We are all needy, and, if we are lucky and any good, we grow old using others and getting used up. Tears fall in our lives like leaves from a tree. Our finitude is not something to be regretted or despised, however; it is what makes giving (and receiving) possible. The more you blame the boy, the more you have to fault human existence. The more you blame the tree, the more you have to fault the very idea of parenting. Should the tree's giving be contingent on the boy's gratitude? If it were, if fathers and mothers waited on reciprocity before caring for their young, then we would all be doomed. ""
So whoever that rated low for this book, I urge you to re-examine the angle you are reading this book.  Take a deep breath and see how much love you have received from the Big Tree in your lives--your parents, your friends, your Creator.

Buy this book for your children, for yourself."

Even though I'm a weight watcher and know how to eat, I often overeat without realizing it.  One tip I really liked is to NEVER eat out of a box or bag.  Even though I try to ""count"" how much I'm eating out of the box, I still eat too much.  Now I pour the snacks into a bowl so I can ""see"" how much I'm eating.  Makes a HUGE difference when the brain registers quantity."

I watch the series one character at a time and never re-watch Paul's messed up personal life (the only character who continues to devolve instead of evolve).  It's the depth of interaction between client, client's inner world, and therapist that delights me most: the slow crumbling of defenses, the re-connection with inner truths, the breakthroughs, the increase in functionality.

Not so, I had to read and read some more once I found I couldn't just mess with a few buttons. I had to calculate my strides and weight in the machine. I like the durable plastic and I don't think it will break that easy as I dropped it a few times to see. But the case is a little hard to open and you must close it in order for it to work. I think it is nice once you figure out how to operate it. The accuracy is decent. I walked 50 and it recorded 63 steps but there's a sensitivity switch you can play with to adjust the accuracy. I will play with that once I go to the gym. Keep in your purse or glove compartment of the car as it may motivate or aggrivate you. I also like the time feature but you can/t use it if the case must be closed while walking. Overall a little complicated if you just want something to count steps or miles IMO.

1637,-1,Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,"There is something to these Himalayan salt lamps. This is the second one I have purchased. When I purchased the first one, I wasn't expecting anything but a cute night light. We normally keep them on all day, until we go to bed. The first thing we noticed was that is seems to attract our pups. They've never tried to eat it or anything crazy. They just want to lay next to it, usually with their heads very close to it. Then I noticed my husband turned it on as soon as he got home every evening. He isn't into hokey gimmicks that may or may not have healing powers or whatever. I'm convinced that there is SOMETHING to this rock! We call them our Zen Rocks :) Maybe the amber glow is relaxing, maybe it's more. When they are not turned on, the pups don't spend much time on that side of our couch. When they aren't on, I keep thinking, I need to get off my lazy behind and turn them on, like they're calling for me ;) I LOVE OUR ZEN ROCKS!

In comparison with the other one I purchased, the color is pretty much the same. They both have a wood base and you insert the bulb into the bottom. They are both a bit oddly shaped and imperfect, which I love. This lamp doesn't have a simple on or off switch. You can turn it all the way on or only light it dimly. The reason I didn't give this lamp five stars is because it arrived in a squished box. I kept my finger crossed, but my heart sunk when I realized that the switch had a big crack in it. Luckily it works despite the crack. I wish it had been wrapped better."

This Schrade knife is too big for everyday carry for work on the property.  Best to strap this to your bag or in the truck.  It becomes a chore lugging it around.  But for what it is and at its price point, you can't beat it for an entry-level quality steel workhorse knife that you can beat up.  The handle becomes too abrasive for bare hands but with gloves, no problem.  The nylon sheath is nothing to write home about but it fits the provided sharpener and fire steel just right.

1652,-1,Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,"I picked this machine up at a garage sale for 10 bucks. It was used once and still in its original box with everything it came with. I figured it was worth a try. I roasted a 5.4-lb chicken and took note of the useful tips I saw throughout the reviews here. Spray the back plate and prongs with cooking spray, line the drip tray with foil, tie the legs and wings to hold together tightly, put it on the rack with the legs facing away from the motor. In 80 minutes it was done without any problems. It was the juiciest chicken we've ever had, very tasty indeed. You cannot get this from your oven, no way. The complaint of some about the heat this puts out wasn't a problem. I have a ceramic cooktop and it was just fine on it. I can't wait to try turkey breast or a very small turkey.
I took one star away for the following: the rotators sometimes have a skip or delay because one wheel sits on the other without any additional latch to keep them together. For chicken roasting this is less of a problem, but I can see lighter foods or unbalanced loads have an issue. There is no on or off button, instead you have to unplug to turn it off and there is no pause button to stop the rotisserie to check for doneness, you have to unplug to stop it. Was it worth $10? Heck yes, would I pay the regular price? Probably not."

I emailed Enerlite and their customer service rep said ""We don't usually get involved with our retailer's customers"", and told me to seek help from Amazon.  But of course it's been a year, so I guess that's all the help I am going to get.  The price is low, but not low enough to warrant buying another one year light switch, so goodbye Enerlite.

1675,-1,Books_5,4,"INVENTING GEORGE WASHINGTON:  AMERICA'S FOUNDER IN MYTH AND MEMORY is an interesting look into some of the many stories we've all heard about George Washington.  Edward Lengel's primary focus in this book isn't so much the myths themselves, but their place in American lore and, more importantly, the reasons behind their origination.  While we all know the ""chopping down the cherry tree"" story is whole-cloth fiction, you'd be surprised at some of the real sources of George Washington quotes and lore that Lengel exposes.

While some were innocent enough embellishments upon actual events or wholly made-up fiction, the reasons behind others are far from innocent.  Whether used for the villification of Washington and the American Experiment OR to further the ends of the idea that America is a ""just cause,"" Lengel delves into the prevelance of the mythology in todays world.

Even after exhaustive publication of authenticated writings directly from the hand of George Washington, many of the myths retain their seeming veracity.  Whether taken from forged writings of George Washington or from the imagination of biographers, admirers or detractors, you'd be surprised by the quoatation of these stories in todays modern era--usually to serve modern political ends.

While Lengel seemed to make no conclusion as to what to do about this problem, it left this reader with one thought in mind:  Before you tell any story--good or bad--or attribute any quotation to George Washington, make sure YOU do your own research and verify its sourcing.  As to the legends?  Maybe they DO serve a purpose and DO have a place in American society. If not for some of them, it might be kind of hard to inspire the American people and keep ol' G.W. ""..first in the hearts of his countrymen.""

I give this book FOUR STARS.  Well worth the read if you have even a passing interest in discovering the REAL George Washington.  Although, that will require additional careful research on your part, you'll at least have a new found suspicion for stories and qoutes being bandied about today!"

It's a thin mat compared to some that I have seen, but it's made of great quality materials and protects my body when I am down on the ground exercising.  It adds just the right amount of support and comfort so I am able to perform my exercises on the hard wood floor without worrying about my knees or back being in pain.  It's made of 1/4"" memory foam and so it's super comfortable when you lay on it.  It provides enough grip to the floor and enough stability to your feet that you won't slip on it.  The mat itself looks really nice.  I bought it in black and it has a nice textured look to it that feels great when you lay on it  There were a few other color choices, but I'm glad I went with the black so you don't see any dirt or sweat on it.  If it does get sweaty, which it usually does, you can just wipe it down with your towel, and then wash it down with a mild soap and hang it to dry, very simple.  The size of the mat itself is about a typical yoga mat I would say, it's long enough for me to stretch out on it and still be off the floor.  It measures 24"" x 72"".

1720,-1,Pet_Supplies_5,4,"To preface, I have a one year old pit bull mix who chews through EVERYTHING. The only toy she has yet to destroy is her black kong, of which she doesn't actually chew on too much. That being said, this seemed like a pretty sturdy toy so I got it since she loves squeak toys and I was looking for something that would actually hold treats and make her work for them. It took about three weeks for her to chew off one of the legs, at which point the toy was still functional, and was actually longer than I was expecting that particular leg to last as she started chewing on it the day she got it. A week later the belly started to tear at one end of the insert, but again, was still functional. A week after that, she chewed through the middle of the body leaving all but the squeaky head (of which she isn't particularly interested in due to the force it takes to make it squeak) no longer functional. Overall, it lasted around 5 weeks, which while I obviously wish it had lasted longer, I'm still generally pleased with the length of time it lasted considering the amount it was played with (a lot but not a TON). I'm considering getting another one but haven't yet decided. I wish they'd make something similar but without legs.

SUMMARY:

PROS:
-Holds up pretty well with major chewers, and probably indestructible for other dogs
-Multi functional as chew toy and very interactive treat dispenser (as well as floats and what not)
-kept my dog occupied when filled with treats or kibble (kibble worked best actually)
-cute
-squeaker isn't too loud

CONS:
-not indestructible for big chewers
-the stupid legs (They're it's weakest point)
-the amount of pressure needed to squeak the head made my dog disinterested in its squeaking ability (but was interested for food purposes)
-Price (which would be totally reasonable to me if it lasted for more than 5 weeks)"

It's more fun than coloring in coloring books... so much fun to create you'll want to do it with the kids, especially if you are sentimental for Shrinky Dinks of the 70's-80's.

If you're not familiar with Shrinky Dinks, once baked the little flexible flat plastic sheets shrink, harden, and thicken to become permanent hard plastic play pieces. You can even poke a hole before baking and hang them on a necklace."

My cockatiels don't complain, they eat it, but they don't get excited over it like they have with the cheaper sweetened and colored seeds. They do have more energy and better moods since switching to this brand from cheap ones. The problem is that one bird loves sunflower seeds, but the other won't touch them. They have separate cages and don't share food. So I buy sunseeds separately for the one who likes them, as the sunseed version of this seed mix is more expensive. I don't know what would get them more excited about this brand - sugar, probably, ha! I don't want them eating sugar except fruit, and this brand has some dried fruit."

I am Legend stars Will Smith as a scientist who has survived a deadly virus that was developed by genetic engineering to kill cancer; instead it has killed off most of mankind.  Smith struggles to live in New York City with his German Shepherd dog surrounded by cannibalistic super strong zombies that only come out at night.  This is a jarring apocalyptic movie that speaks well of Hollywood.  I'm glad that someone in Hollywood is reading Science Fiction.

I too bought it for the retro look (as I did the Cuisinart) but looks aren't everything. It toasts much slower than its predecessor. If I read an expert review right, the light/dark knob controls a timer rather than a toast sensor, which means no consistency between say white or wheat bread, etc.

1771,-1,Pet_Supplies_5,4,I probably should give this 5 stars because my Cockatiel ADORES this toy. These are her favorite. I got her in June and I have already ordered 3 of them. She loves ripping them apart and they are the only toy she really shows interest in at all. They also are just the size I was looking for to hang under a rope perch on the top of her cage where I've designed her a little play area. I use the perch as sort of a bridge and this toy is short enough to hang underneath and not touch the cage so she can swing it around and chew it up. I wish I could find them locally because the reason I gave it four stars was the 2nd time I ordered I ordered two since she tears them up so quickly and one came just fine but the other one was missing pieces one of the wicker balls was just in pieces in the bottom of the box and a couple pieces of the colored wood were laying in the box as well. She already tears them up pretty quickly and having it already missing pieces definitely makes it last even less time. It was aggravating to me because the toys came in a box from Amazon with other items I had ordered at the same time and all were individually packaged within the cardboard box except these two toys which were just thrown in with nothing but a tag saying Super Bird Creations. No bag around them no cardboard nothing just thrown in the bottom of the box and the one was damaged. It is still a good toy though and your bird will love it just be prepared to buy them in bulk ;)

And a lot of those expectations were met: beautiful cinematography, a good amount of music, a nice tragic love story, over-the-top but well-done drama. Unfortunately though, it got pretty slow towards the end, and the music wasn't nearly as integrated as it could (and I think should) have been.  I'm not sure an entire song was ever played through, and it wasn't nearly as important to the plot of the movie as it was, for example, in Moulin Rouge. I was disappointed. But as for the rest of the movie, the acting was great and the story was great, and there's not much more you need for a high rating from me."

I was very happy to receive this as a gift from my husband (who is terrible at picking out jewelry. this was on the short list that I sent him so he could ""surprise"" me in pre-approved fashion. ) :)) Of course it's lightweight, as some reviewers have noted--a completely solid (filled) 14k gold bracelet would cost a fortune!!!! Most gold jewelry these days is hollow, to reduce cost. For me this is great, because I can't stand heavy jewelry, so this is just like my other Duragold bangles. very light and very comfortable to wear all day long. I've had it for about 3 months now, maybe 4, I wear it almost every day with other jewelry, and see no dents or dings (people who complain about 14k jewelry sustaining dents might want to remember that all 14k jewelry is somewhat soft and prone to dents with heavy or careless use). Additionally, the etching is doing a great job of hiding any scratches it might have sustained. So if you ""play rough"" or regularly tend to, for example, run into walls (??) gold jewelry might not be ideal for you. If you play nice, this is a great bangle, looks very sparkly with the diamond etching, and has a lovely sturdy clasp and a great shape. You won't want to take it off. If you have questions about size, a sizing chart is provided above, and it's very easy to convert millimeters into inches using the Internet. or a ruler. or math. :) 10 mm equals 1 cm. 2. 5 cm equals 1 inch.

It was easy to read and flowed easily. But, the subject matter was a little hard at times, and a little spicy too. I found myself wanting to yell at the hero  and heroine. I guess if you do that, then it's a very compelling book. I felt like I was there along side them every step of the way in their journey.  I went ahead and read the second book because this one left me hanging. I just had to see what happened next in Katie and Keith's lives.(because I feel like family now) I'm very glad I did because it made me appreciate what they went through and how redemption is such a gift of God.

For starters, and probably most importantly for people who had the old one, there is a major improvement in the voice recognition.  Where before the password had to be said with EXACTLY the same tone (and background noise), the new version does a better (not perfect, but better) job of filtering background noise and is significantly more forgiving of the tone.  Fore example, when my 7yo tried to open her old Password Journal, if it didn't open the first time or two she would get frustrated and that frustrated tone would ensure it would not open at all.  This journal is more forgiving in the first place, and even if she gets frustrated it still responds about half of the time.

Now let's be real, this isn't a real diary-type journal.  It's definitely a gimmicky toy, so if your little one is looking for something more secure, an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/old-fashioned-locking-diary/dp/B00NYAGMQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">old-fashioned locking diary</a>&nbsp;may be a better bet.  For the gadget girl who likes to fiddle with tech this is a fun toy, complete with invisible(-ish) ink, a ""hidden"" (in the most obvious way) compartment, and the namesake verbal password.  The journal book itself is small, but my 7yo took it out and keeps random notes to and from friends in there instead.  When she pressed her friends to try to get into the journal, it says ""intruder alert!"" and they all giggled wildly, scheming of ways to keep secret notes from their nemesis: little brother.

Of course there's a password bypass on the back, which means it's never really secure.  Which is fine, a 7yo doesn't need to be keeping secrets from her parents anyway.  ;-)."

1803,-1,Electronics_5,1,"It's a crap shoot whether or not my Alienware laptop will even boot with this thing attached. When it works, it's great, but it's so finicky that I never want to hook it up because it might take me 2 hours to get my computer started if I do. Very disappointed in this purchase.

Also, Dell makes it nearly impossible to find the software for this thing on their website. It is not detected by their support helper application and does not seem to have the ""service tag"" that is needed to find drivers and other software for your machine. There's tons of software to choose from one you do find it, but it's pure luck to download and install the correct software as everything is named the same and not labeled appropriately for specific machines and operating systems (it LOOKS like it is, but I have downloaded many packages for this device that indicate my specific laptop and OS, only to get a message that says :this software does  not work with this machine"" upon trying to install. Hugely frustrating and a gigantic fail on Dell's part."

1808,-1,Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,"Low-end, Shimano/SRAM hub compatible 9-speed cassette.  It's heavy, and designed for steel hubs.  Works like a champ.  Holds up to high wattage, and standing on a climb in the large gear.

If you have aluminum or titanium hubs, or are concerned about a couple of ounces of weight, then you want a higher-numbered cassette with a large-gear spider.

This is very wide range, pretty evenly stepped from 11T to 34T.  This is great for a compact double crankset (34/50), giving a 1:1 (WHEELIES!) for monster climbs, and a 4.5:1 for powering downhill at 35mph.

Since it's 9-speed, and such a wide range, you may find some of the mid spacing a little too much if you are mostly on even, flat pavement.

If you do only hard, off-road climbs, you may find this is not enough (vs some of the new 42T pizza plates lately).
END 2014 review

EDIT 2017 - Subtracting a star because the description now says it has a spider, but it does not.  A spider is a solid block of aluminum serving as the core for the biggest cogwheels.  It reduces weight, and distributes the load so high-wattage does not dig into the freehub splines.  THIS CASSETTE DOES NOT HAVE THAT.  The description should not say it does."

1828,-1,Movies_and_TV_5,4,"During the seventies, german director Werner Herzog has given us three movies - AGUIRRE, THE WRATH OF GOD, KASPAR HAUSER and HEART OF GLASS - which stay as unique pearls in Movie History. This director is a visionary,  one of the rare authors who have been able to create a cinematic world out  of their dreams. Just watch and listen to the featurette (Thank you, Anchor  Bay): this guy is an authentic genius coming from the same family of the  Saints of the Middle Ages or the most famous composers.
NOSFERATU, shot  in 1978, tries to establish a link between the german directors of the  1918-1926 period, Fritz Lang or Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau for instance,  authors who reigned over international cinema at that time and the new  generation of german directors that appeared in the late sixties with such  remarkable individuals as Rainer-Werner Fassbinder, Wim Wenders or Werner  Herzog.
Werner Herzog is also the last of the XIXth german romantics with  his images haunted by nostalgy, with his heroes able to see what is  invisible to common people. You have to enter into NOSFERATU as if you're  about to dream. If not, you'll surely be bored after 5 minutes. But if you  find in yourself the courage to follow Werner Herzog, you will experiment  something you'll never forget.
Other Werner Herzog's movies will be  released in the DVD standard very soon, so be prepared to dream.

The reason I prefer this pan over others is that I bake mini brownies, cupcakes, carrot cakes and 'mini bite"" pastries of all kinds.  I use the fluted paper baking cups that measure 1-1/2"" X 1""
deep.  I use Reynolds brand, FC150x350 paper baking cups. the box says 3-1/2"" fluted cups, but that's the measurement before the cups are formed at the factory. *** Since the cups of this pan are only 3/4"" deep it allows the cakes and brownies to slightly ""flair out"" at the top; making them look larger than the ones made in deeper pans with the same 2"" diameter at the top.

I baked the identical pastries (half made in this pan, and others that were baked in the pans that were !"" deep). I offered them on trays set side by side, telling customers that they were ""IDENTICAL IN WEIGHT AND VOLUME"". Not one customer chose the pastries that were baked in the deeper pans. When you look at the finished product; made in this pan, it ""LOOKS"" and IS larger at the top!

I LOVE this pan, above any of the others and ""HIGHLY RECOMMEND"" it! The non-stick surface is outstanding too.

The Commercial II non-stick 24 cup mini- muffin pan measures 15-3/4"" by II""; each muffin measures 2"" in diameter and 3/4"" deep.

As a size 36DD woman, it is very hard to find something that not only has good support, but is feminine and pretty too. This bra designer understands the needs of a heavily busted woman. First of all, they give you an extra hook and eye bra strap extender to allow your bra to fit perfectly throughout a little weight gain or weight loss. No back fat is going to be created by this band not fitting well. The straps are softly padded over the shoulders, so nothing digs in leaving those red strap marks on your shoulders at the end of the day. The underwire supported cups of the bra give full coverage and also great support holding everything at the right height and in place. They are lightly lined for comfort and concealment and the lace and bow accents are very feminine. Nothing shows through your clothing ~ even the lace overlay on the cups. I believe for me this was a perfect fit - it did not run too large or too small. I would certainly love to have a drawer full of these bras, as I personally could not ask for anything better made, more reasonable priced or with a better fit than this bra.

This 4 Watt is exactly what I've been looking for and an amazing light bulb! The placement of where we use this light is in our bedroom fan light. I feel so much better knowing that we are only using much less power instead of full 40 wattage of an incandescent bulb.

I have attached several pictures for comparison between the original style light bulb and this E12 base dimmable candelabra bulb. The first picture shows the size comparison between the 40W incandescent light bulb and this 4W LED candle light bulb (practically the same size). They have the same E12 base size and these light bulbs are for light fixtures such as chandeliers, fans, etc (not for tiny night lights). The construction and quality of the light bulb is so sturdy and excellent. The other picture shows how the LED light bulb glows and puts off a ton of light. This particular bulb is a Warm White which is my favorite and preferred choice of light bulb color. Ive come to realize the Bright White bulbs look too blue for my taste and the Warm yellow looks too much like my grandmas house. So my preference is in the middle at the warm white.

I tested the dimmable feature of these light bulbs as our fans have dimmable remotes to control the light. There is no flicker in the bulb at all and looks like a normal bulb when dimming. I think having the LED light with the characteristic of being dimmable is a huge plus since our fan has a remote with a dimmer switch and it works like a charm. I like the option to dim whenever I want to. I wish I would have bought this light sooner and started saving my energy bills! I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review/opinion."

It does not upset her skin. I have to give it a full scoop every day. My dog is the most picky eater I have ever seen. I give her a lot of treats and I give her a lot of treats because she loves to eat so much. She is eating about 1/4 cup every day, which is about half the size of a regular food. It is definitely a healthy food for her and she eats it without hesitation. I am going to give this 5 stars because it is not too expensive. I have had it for a while now and I have noticed that it has no additives in it. She is not picky, so I don't think I will have to worry about her eating this much. My dog is about 20 lbs and weighs about 18 pounds. She has no trouble with it. I have tried other brands and she has been fine with this one. I have tried other brands and the dog is not picky. I also like the quality of the ingredients and the fact that it is grain free. I will continue to purchase this brand. My dogs love this food. It is a bit pricey, but they like it. I've had this for 2 months now. It's still working but I'm not sure how it's going to hold up."
1874,-1,Pet_Supplies_5,5,"If your using Tidy Cat your not using the best.  We where faithful Tidy Cat purchasers for over 10 years then after taking up our carpets to go back to the hardwood underneath we where shocked by how much litter was in and under the carpet, yes we vacuum.
Within a week of having hardwood floors again we where shocked how much litter was all over the house, not to mention in the bed - ughh.  Also we found that Tidy Cat wasn't clumping as well as it use to and we were always fishing out tiny clumps too.
Well it was time to do something about the mess so we decided to try a different litter.  WOW if you have never used Cat's Pride Fresh and Light litter you have to try it!  Tidy Cat is like little balls, Cat's Pride is not.  Cat's Pride is a very light litter which is a big plus, no strong scent and clumps great!  We have 2 covered litter boxes side by side one still with Tidy and one with Cat's Pride. I put a 4' x 5' piece of astro truf (outdoor type) in front of the boxes and still have to sweep Tidy off the hardwood in that room, hallway and adjoining rooms but no Cat's Pride.

This is not your typical, happily ever after romance novel. I was hooked on this book from the first page & had a hard time putting my Kindle down. All the characters are seriously flawed but they are relatable and they draw you in. There are some grammatical & typographical errors, which usually annoy me to no end, but the story was so compelling I was able to overlook them.

I originally ordered a size XL (which according to the manufacturer is a size 14 - 16, which is WAY bigger than I ever wear). It was STILL TOO SMALL and insanely TIGHT. I ordered an XXL (which apparently is a size 18-20!!!!!) It's a bit looser around the waist, but still pretty tight the rest of the way down. Honestly - and surprisingly - this skirt is really probably most flattering on a smaller sized body - guess they don't call it a pencil skirt for no reason. I do think it's extremely cute though, despite it not being the best fit.

Later on, if I find it is a lot better, I will find and update this posting.  I do hope it helps someone out there who is fearful of it failing.

1920,-1,Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,"First - about sizing. The Amazon size choices for this item list many 'tall' sizes that the are not available on the NeoSport website.  The only 'tall' size offered by NeoSport is 'Large/Tall'.  So - even though I ordered an XLTall from Amazon I expected to get just an XL. That was OK with me since it is usually a sleeve length issue for me and since this item is a vest sleeve length did not matter. When the vest arrived it was tagged XLT (just like I ordered). I don't know why this item is available, from Amazon anyway, in sizes that the company does not advertise. I looked for other NeoSport items on Amazon that might come in 'tall' sizes but found none.
  About the vest...I am 6'4"" tall and have a 35"" waist and a 45"" chest and weigh 200#. The XLT fits me perfectly. A very snug fit but that is the way a wetsuit item should fit for best performance. It has a heavy duty zipper that is backed by a flap of fabric so you don't catch any chest hair on the way up and down. After paddling 4 hours this afternoon the zipper stayed in place without working its way down. The arm holes seem a little small but that adds to the effectiveness of the insulation qualities. I could feel the fabric at the arm holes while paddling but did not get any chafing. Next time out I will try wearing a lightweight wicking shirt under the vest just to see if it feels any different.
  This item is priced pretty closely with other items of its type, although some I have tried did not have the protective flap of fabric backing the zipper.
  If this thing falls apart on me I will try to edit this review but for now I am very pleased with this purchase."

If you have nothing to do some afternoon, or are on a flight from NYC to Chicago with a Philly layover, you could do worse. I suppose.  I will give Heller the latitude to play with grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure in the narration, until it becomes clear the narrator is an English major with literary pretensions doing a self-conscious and bad Hemingway imitation. That part is just painful.

Ok, most of this novel has a brisk plot, so WTH not play along? Well because by the end of the afternoon, or flight, you might find you have just spent 4 hours sitting in a kid's basement swapping fever dreams about what you would each do if there was this awesome, crazy really gross disease that like totally destroys the world but it really doesn't but you know it almost does and it still might, you know? but you had like wicked cool weapons AND A PLANE!!!!

I had to replace a few of the chicken flavor, which is okay, but it's not the best. I would suggest trying some of the other flavors. Also, my dogs love these. I have a 60 lb terrier who is so obsessed with these he just eats them all. I think he really enjoys the flavor. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase. My dog absolutely loves this bed. She loves to sit on it and it's a great size. It fits perfectly in her crate and she's not afraid of anything. It's a nice small bed for her to sleep on. I'll be buying another one soon.

I completely fell in love with Leslie, although I had fallen for him before, this book just proved that my love for the funny, quirky guy was well founded and deserved.

Leslie has a tendency to put his foot in his mouth, but it is honestly so heartwarming to read about a character who will say what they feel, and I have been told on many occasions that I need a filter....so I feel as if me and Leslie are one in the same. Although that man can rock the heels so much better than I.

Oliver, has scars - both on the outside and inside. That man wound his way into my heart, and I am so grateful that he did.

I cheered for Leslie and Oliver, I cried when I feared things would not end up the way I had hoped, I laughed - a lot.

Susan Mac Nicol has a way with words, and her Men of London are just another reason I want to jump in a plane and plan a trip.......I want to find these guys and hug them all, and never let go. Thank you Susan for writing such a wonderful book, one that will be read over, and over again."

1954,-1,Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,"I own several Gerber knives, and overall I like the them, Gerber makes a solid knife. However, like most Gerber knives the steel used in this blade is average, 440 high carbon. It does not hold an edge that well and dents/chips fairly easily. The added features, i.e. sharpener/whistle/fire starter are nice. Although the fire starter is crap, it broke on the first use with minimal force used. The sheath is fantastic, more impressive than the blade in my opinion, very durable. The grip of the knife is also quite nice, comfortable and sturdy, no slip at all. All in all if you are an occasional outdoors man and looking for a decent affordable survival knife this is a good buy. But if your looking for a blade thats made of better steel (Aus8) and overall durability and blade retention quality and still at decent price, I would suggest the SOG Seal Pup. No bells and whistles. Just the blade but it's a fantastic knife and if purchased from amazon not much more expensive than the this knife. Basically if you want a knife that if your life depended on it, I would not go with this Gerber, go with an SOG or maybe a Kabar. Bear Grylls is a badass and there is no way he would trust his life to this blade."

I could not put it down,"
1971,-1,Books_5,5,"At first I thought this book was taking place along time ago, because being from the USA, it's hard to think women are not even close to being equals with men,  in many parts of the world. It was shocking when the story was talking about planes and phones, that I got a wake up call this was a romance story for now. I personally thought  Hajar's reaction to his trauma was right on. People had a hard time looking at him, so of course, he would feel like the beast. I also liked the spunk of Katherine. My heart ached for her, on the reaction of her father, just because she was a women. I truly can't believe this book is free, I liked it that much. There is love making, but not the erotica type. The romance builds, which I also liked, they just don't fall head over heels for each other and have sex right away."
1972,-1,Books_5,4,"In the previous installment of the Heroes of Olympus series, we learned that Percy Jackson, much like Jason in The Lost Hero, has lost his memory and is at a camp for demigods that he's never known of: Camp Jupiter. As with most of the books in both The Heroes of Olympus series and the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, we begin at the camp (though the Roman camp operates very differently from Camp Half-blood) before embarking upon a seemingly impossible quest. Rick Riordan never misses an ingredient in his books. Adventure? We've got that in spades as Percy and his new friends, Frank and Hazel take on monsters, Amazons, gorgons, and giants on their quest. Serious shtuff? Well let's see. Both Frank and Hazel have had issues with their families, Percy can't remember the rest of his life, and there's that itty-bitty little ""Gaia's trying to take over the world"" thing they've got to contend with. Romance? Got that too, just a bit. Annabeth is all that Percy really remembers and. well, I don't want to spoil you. Let's just say that's a pinch more crushiness (I'm making up words now, deal with it) than that. And humor? Um, hello? Percy's back and he's always been sarcastic and a little hilarious. Frank and Hazel aren't missing a sense of humor either. When the mood gets a little darker it doesn't last long, one of them will either crack a joke or Riordan will throw in a hilarious villain to break it without interrupting the flow of the story. Basically, The Son of Neptune did not disappoint. Overall Rating: 4. 5/5. Greek mythology lovers and fans of Harry Potter (especially the earlier books) are sure to love this Middle Grade series. - See more at: [."

Club groupies (there is a better word but Im not sure if it would fly with the Zon) are often portrayed as horrible women so the blurb of this book really drew me in and once started I really was hooked.

Her place in the club was more for her than it was anything else, and she would not let anybody put her down when it came to choosing what she did.

1982,-1,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,"These are adorable shoes and they fit well. My daughter is 6 months and I bought the 0-6 months size because Robeez tend to run large. She has some space to grow, so I anticipate they'll fit her for some time yet--hopefully until the summer at least. There is about a fingertip of space towards the toe. The flower strap does not open, but stretches to accommodate the foot, and I anticipate these will stay on just as well as her Robeez boots. I've tried buying Robeez knockoffs (the ones at Target) and they never stay on or don't fit right, whereas these fit great and are wonderfully constructed. The only real disappointment is that they are made in China. I am always somewhat concerned about quality control with regard to goods coming out of China, but it's very difficult to avoid such products. However, these do look like they were constructed with care."

So I figured it would suck and give Jurassic Park a bad name. I was wrong. This one had the most action and was the most intense one in the series. I would give it 5 stars,but you just can't compare it to to the previous two. I was real glad to see Sam Neil return as Dr. Grant. He may not be the most popular actor, but he's a good one. The special effects were great as usual. ""The Lost World's"" visuals weren't a whole lot better than the first one, but you can tell a significant difference in Jurassic Park III. The dino's are more detailed and relistic looking than the other two movies. The music on the other hand wasn't as good. John Williams didn't conduct the score for this one, so the music didn't quite have the same touch as the other two. Of course the movie had it's cheesy parts. For one example, the ending when the army and Navy showed up to rescue them. It was to unrelistic. The movie is still great though. It's a great conclusion and ending to a wonderful movie series."

Some of the tools are also designed to be used in a pinch, but it's a little difficult to grip your hand when you are holding it.  If you have a small hand, it's a bit harder to grip the tool when you are holding it.  I have my hands on all four tools, and none of them have held up well.

You could apply any leather polish - for example the stuff for leather bicycle seats or baseball gloves - to darken it a shade instantly.

This item is definitely not what the average-sized female would consider as a 1-size fit.  I am 5'7"", 36 DDD and have a long torso.  I started not to even bother trying it on because it looks tiny coming out of the package.  Once I had it on, I found that the elastic under the bust area does reach where it needs to and the stretch of the fabric didn't make it feel like it was too small.  It even reached far enough to cover my backside but wasn't long enough to wear into a public place such as a store/coffee shop, etc., after a day at the beach.  The material is soft, slinky, inviting and very comfortable, even despite the fact that I thought it was too small.  The colors are bright, vibrant and cheerful.  Despite the fact that it was too short for my long torso, there is a generous cut to the item which gave a nice flowy feel to it.  I'm keeping it to pass on to my 5'4"" daughter whom I'm sure will love it!  A great value at this price, especially for the right sized person."

I wanted something loose-ish to sleep in, bought lgt gray, not usually forgiving color. I thought these not only fit perfect but also look cute enough to wear out. They are about mid-rise, with wide waistband. You could pull it down for a lower rise pant. I haven't actually worn them, I know people say drawstring is decorative only.  I could have even gone small, so for skinny people these could be too loose. I was pleasantly  surprised w pant and It's a forgiving style. Of course this is just my opinion everyone has different shapes. Hope this helps
  REVISION;  Ok have to revise my feedback. I washed these pants, shrank 1full size, no longer forgiving color , no longer cute. They didn't soften up in wash, they were stiff, but I thought they pressed them. They are 90%cotton. These pants are now just OK , I'll wear 4 sleeping only but nt even soft. Price is inexpensive and I if ur thin lighter colors should look fine. Any extra curve  recommend darker color and order up. They will shrink. I wear a 6 ladies and 9 juniors . Hope this was helpful.

2017,-1,Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4,"It has my seal of approval, and I fully recommend it.  I bought 2 of the Gizmode water alarm detectors, several sensor pad attachments, and 1 sump pump attachments.  Despite their very small sizes and nearly negligible mass, they all worked straight out of the box as I tested everything right away.  I found that the sensor pad attachments were as thin as advertised yet fully effective - they fit quite easily under our washing machine, and water heater.  Though the simplicity of the sump pump attachment surprised me, it was none-the-less very sturdy and worked well, so I placed it intentionally low in the sump so it would sound off just before the pump would activate - and it did.  The alarm was just loud enough to hear on the 2nd floor so my recommendation to Gizmode would be to make it even louder - but it still gets the job done.  It is now at the perfect ""peace of mind level"" where it is high enough in the sump that it won't sound off unless the sump pump fails to work."

This was wordy with huge sections of nothing-ness that didn't advance the plot and didn't help grow the characters. To be honest I found the intrepid, spunky heroine, Abra Walsh, to be very annoying. There wasn't much chemistry between her and Eli Landon. The most interesting character in my opinion was Landon's grandmother and she appeared infrequently. There were two mysteries running simultaneously with a connection--seemed overly convoluted. I don't feel Roberts set the basis for the story very well. So if you are thinking of giving this book a second try--I don't think you are going to be much happier with it the second time around!"

Now as high school is coming to a close the pair have decided to attend a party but when Vivienne separates from Ray to use the restroom their world is torn apart in an instant.

Twenty years after the massive event happened that claimed the lives of a lot of the other teens in attendance at the part Vivienne appears out of nowhere. Everyone she knew has aged even though she hasn't at all. Vivienne longs for Ray to also return but when he doesnt she dedicates her life to figuring out time travel to hopefully save Ray from whatever event had sucked her into the future.

A Betrayal of Time by Lucia Ashta is a novella length fantasy read that had a great story of lovers ripped apart but would do anything to be together again. The town thought it was an earthquake that had stolen the lives of their children until the day Vivienne appeared again. Once it was known that she wasn't the only one whos body hadnt been recovered she dedicates her life to figuring out what had happened.

While being a short read the author did a wonderful job weaving together the time travel along with letting the readers know enough about the characters to care about their outcome. This is definitely one Id recommend to the fantasy/time travel lovers out there.

2034,-1,Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,"First and foremost, I do not get paid to write reviews. I also did not receive this product for free in exchange for a good review.

This is no lightweight bike. I was actually pretty stunned to receive the box and there was considerable weight to it. The instructions were decent and it took about 20 minutes to put together. The only thing is that the pedals and straps are plastic, so I wonder how long they will hold up.

This is a very quiet bike. I can easily be riding this while watching TV and I never need to increase the volume. Its literally that quiet.

The little display is decent and does a fairly good job. Just know that you will need to hold the button down to reset your last ride information.

There is quite the large seat on this, but with the pedals where they are, you won't use much of it unless you have super long legs. Im 511 and I can only use the front half of the seat. Its fairly comfortable and Im thankful for that.

If there is one *ding* to this bike is the seat location compared to the pedals. My butt is roughly at 50 degrees to the metals, which isn't a normal feeling. Its abojt midway between a normal bike and a recumbent bike. I do wish the pedals were more beneath me like a normal bike, but for a space saver bike at this price, I cant really complain too much.

This classic film, made even as the war clouds were gathering in Europe and armies on the march in Asia, is well-acted and an excellent adaptation of the original novel. I even love the lamasery, even though it seems more art deco than Tibetan. To be sure, this film was restored through several techniques, replacing lengths of film removed when it was originally shown, using stills to supplement surviving adio, etc. This technique was used with Metropolis and I think it works at  least as well with Lost Horizon."

This model is different than the Wembley model. On the Wembley model only the thin bar rotates up and you can easily slide the rolls on and off--but I found that the bar rattles a bit . On this model the end of the bar that pivots is attached to about an inch wide segment of  the support bracket.  The roll of paper still fits over the segment--and the extra weight on this pivoting end keeps it from rattling.

I feel saddened by the vitriol that can result from anyone either agreeing or disagreeing with these ideas. Although I have left theism behind, it has not been without struggle or deep sadness. My former beliefs gave me so much comfort and joy, and a sense of purpose, all of which have now been torn from me. Therefore, I don't condemn or rail against those who still cling to them fiercely. I understand their anger against these ideas - an anger born of fear bordering on panic. And I don't want to be so smugly certain I am right now, as I was so smugly certain I was right when I was a fundamentalist literalist Christian. I have gained much, but may have lost even more.

The 514 has been variously labeled as a straight fit or a slim straight fit. I believe this should be correctly labeled as a slim straight fit. However it is nowhere close to being skinny. In my opinion these are best suited for my body type (I am 180cm and 178lbs - with relatively slimmer legs). They hug the thighs just so correctly and do not feel baggy.

They look equally great with moccasins and sneakers - though hang a little loose at the end with my dress shoes. I haven't had a chance to wear them with boots - but I think they would do okay with boots as well (I do not like bootcuts).

The Dirt Rush color is very neutral - a little bit lighter than it appears in the photograph (not necessarily a bad thing) - and looks more greenish in sunlight - however very subdued.

Elsa though surprises him and realizing she has no plan, he offers to help her out.  At first Elsa questions Noah's intentions but realizes he has never been part of the bullying she accepts.  Noah doesn't plan on falling for Elsa though and he does, Elsa though is afraid of what going public will do.

I liked this a lot.  Noah's view on why Elsa is trying to lose weight is not what you would think.  Elsa is vulnerable, her mother is a class act and I can understand Elsa's choices.  Great read."

2094,-1,Toys_and_Games_5,5,"I remember the 12 inch Indiana Jones doll back in 1981 that was out for about a week, it seemed anyway. It was imposable to find then and I have been waiting for it for years! (Because I wouldn't pay the ridiculous price for it as time went by).
Now with the new movie coming out, thank GOD, here come the Indy figures and dolls! (As nerdy as that sounds). I chose this one over the talking Indy simply because it looks more like Indiana than the other does. It isn't the old 81 doll I remember as a kid but it'll do, for now. The detail is nice as are the accessories. Unfortunately it has ""whip cracking action"" which means if you move a lever on his back his arm moves the whip up and down. Does anyone at Hasbro have the slightest clue how useless this feature is? It's a minor nuisance and overall it's worth owning though other companies are now making much better detailed versions of Indiana Jones in 12"" form."

To get it to grind, I have to constantly shake the unit while grinding so that the blades are grinding coffee beans versus air. The dial is so loose for the grind grading, that just touching it could shift it. Same with the timer. Don't accidentally touch it because the time will shift. Finally, there is ground coffee all over the counter-top every day because the cup is so static that there is coffee in and out of the cup. I don't usually write reviews much, much less bad one.

I am a 32 year old man and this is a great buy.I had no issues with this product. The size was perfect and the quality was good. I received a 2 day delivery on the package. I had to return it due to the fact that it was just a cheap replacement. I was happy to get a replacement and a good product for the price.I bought this for a friend who has a small head and he uses it for just about everything.  The color is bright, and the straps are solid and secure.  It is a very good quality product and looks great on his head.  It is easy to install and works well.  My only gripe is the strap is not the right size for my head.  I am 5'2"" and the size is right for my head.  It does not fit my 5'6"" head well and I am worried about it coming loose.  I don't like it but I have not had any issues with it.  The strap does not fit my head well and I have not had any problems with it.  The material on the strap is not thick and it is a little uncomfortable to wear.  I will update this review as I get more information.I've used this for my son's tennis and he loves it. He also plays with it now and he loves it.Very comfortable.  Very comfortable to wear.I really like the color.  This is a great hat.  It is very well made and looks nice.

This item is more suited for covering your pack in light rain and when hiking on wide trails but I wouldn't use it if your hiking trail has a lot of branches and bushes close to the path, it could easily puncture it."

2105,-1,Books_5,4,"As a stand-alone book, The Long Earth takes its time getting started, which may put off Pratchett's usual audience. The thing is, it's not a stand-alone. It's the first half of a 2-part series, which may explain they very many apparently random events and characters and why the ending feels so odd: it's not really the end.

The Long Earth is equal parts SF and real (and very hardcore) science, with a huge number of callbacks to Sir Pterry's Science of Discworld books. Pratchett and Baxter's world-building is outstanding, believable, and meticulous. Well, aside from the steampunk airship. The humour is far more subtle than most of Pratchett's other work; more like Nation than the Discworld novels.

Like Pratchett's Unseen Academicals, The Long Earth has a vaguely hallucinatory feel. This may be intentional, or a symptom of the Embuggerance. For all that, it's a relatively quick and easy read. If you're unsure about buying it, you may want to borrow a copy from a friend."

2108,-1,Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,"I am surprised at some of the reviews that consider this a small chair.  Although it doesn't feel like a 17th-century King's throne, and although it is recommended to not be used by anyone over 225 lbs, my 6'3"" 200+ lb frame fits into this chair quite comfortable, with space on either side.

This is a comfortable chair, the lumbar support is nice, the air lift works smoothly so far, and it was fairly easy to assemble (it took me 40 minutes from start to finish).  I like that the arms tilt up if you want them out of the way... of course I didn't know this when assembling it and though something was wrong!  I should also mention the metal armrests were both labeled ""J"" (instructions called one ""I"" and one ""J"") and took me awhile to figure out which is which, genius that I am.

The upholstery is a textured brownish-grey, with the metal frame kind of somewhere between a gold/nickel color.... I would think it'd be important to know this going in if your color scheme is important.

For me, the question of whether this chair is worth the $ is its longevity.  Will the upholstery pull or tear easily?  Will the up/down mechanism last?  Etc.  If I think of it I will check in here with an update in 6 months.  One wants a chair like this to last several years, of course, so, we will see.  For now, a solid 4 stars for a major upgrade over my last office chair!"

Hint: Remove the rain cover from the cart and store it in the bag rather than where the company hides it.
She wanted the red one, but I talked her into black and she is glad I did. The Red/Black combo tries to look stylish, but comes off too industrial in real life. The red bag by itself would be terrific, but not paired with the black rolling cart. Interior size is adequate as expected. Anything roomier would look like every other generic rolling case. This vertical bag stands out from the crowd, but remains professional. I thought the patent leather would be gaudy, but it's subdued by the patterns.  Be a good husband and purchase this."
2123,-1,Movies_and_TV_5,2,"If you don't recoil from the idea of a school teacher in charge of your children's education who smokes dope, lies, steals, manipulates those around her, uses movies to babysit her class while she sleeps off a hangover every morning and is totally devoid of any sense of professional responsibility to her students, then maybe you'll find this film funny.

The overriding conceit at the heart of `Bad Teacher' is the idea that the audience will somehow look past the reprehensible moral bankruptcy at the core of the central character (played to perfection by Cameron Diaz) and root for her, because she's good looking and has a few memorable one-liners so all can be forgiven. The character Diaz plays so well is dishonest, greedy, lazy, irresponsible, rude, utterly self-serving and in every way despicable. She is educating your kids, folks, and her manipulative, blackmailing ways win out for her in the end. This is funny, OK?

The film gets two stars rather than one because, on a purely technical level, it works as a (very improbable) narrative. The storyline is coherent and the editing snappy, the actors give their all, the script does have its moments, it's watchable. But somehow it's hard to get past the overall message the film leaves you with: if you're a selfish, lying, morally bankrupt, pot-smoking, drunken, money-grubbing whore willing to blackmail and deceive all around you whilst having complete contempt for any kind of professional responsibility to your students and their futures, this is in some way admirable. You will win out over more honest and responsible people, and it's hilarious.

I love the characters for not being boring but having some larger than life personalities with just the right amount of neurosis to make them very human and likeable. The worlds that they inhabit are just as varied as the people that live on them. This is the story of Steffania Rickard and Ramsey DeKieran's, the Captain of the Blue Daggers and a disgraced Lord who was found guilty of murder.

Captain Rickard is sent to bring Ramsey to meet with Ari and Doral to discuss a mission they wish him to under take that could mean a full pardon for him, if he returns. Ramsey has been a part of her fantasies since they fought side by side in the Haarb wars, but she would never give into them. Ramsey finds the Captain attractive but knows a woman like her could never give in to the types of hungers he has. Both are very wrong.

The pair are sent to bring back a Verdantian who is very important to the survival of the planet, Lady Alessa DeAlbero has been sold to Veacon Narr, a man who takes pleasure in bringing women to their knees. Everyone else who has attempted a rescue has not returned and he is considered to be expendable even if Steffania isn't. But together they find a way to do the impossible.

Though the story revolves around their rescue effort it is really about two people who have had the worst happen to them but are finding someone to complete them. Highly recommend."

Then: Kind of an odd feel when you are toweling off (I used it after a swim)...in part because it lacks that certain degree of heft you have come to expect from a towel, and in part because it has a microfiber ""tackiness"" for lack of a better word.

Only disappointment was that even though he talked about a lot of their biggest hits - Satisfaction, Start Me Up, Miss You, Jumpin' Jack Flash, and so on - he didn't say a word about Shes So Cold, which I always thought was a great song, and an important one because it made a statement - that after Disco and Punk Rock had pretty much come and gone, the Stones were still around, and they could still come up with a tune that was better than anything anyone else had out there."

2174,-1,Toys_and_Games_5,5,"I started looking for climbing toys for our now 17mth old before Christmas & after hours online, this was my fav. I planned to buy it for our daughters big Santa gift but hesitated after reading some reviews about poor safety features...when the priced dropped after Christmas, I'd still not found anything I liked better so I decided to give it a shot. I am SO glad I ignored the few negative reviews. It is absolutely perfect for our energetic, climbing toddler. She is able to climb the wall with no trouble, the slide is fast & long enough for her to enjoy, she can get a ball into the basketball hoop herself & while the potential is there with most any toy for a child to use it incorrectly and possibly get hurt, under minimal supervision, I see no imminent risk in this toy. (the concerns I read were toddlers ""diving"" through the hole for footballs to be thrown through). That particular opening in question does not hit our child in a place height wise where that is an issue. If she's standing, the hole is around her belly, if she sits, she can peek through the hole, but with the majority of her body safely on the platform, she isn't likely to fall from it. A child, if intentionally trying to dive through, coud get it through it I guess but it doesnt seem very probable. Again, I'm glad I bypassed that info and ordered anyway. I was also glad it was not quite as huge as I'd envisioned, it will be easy to move outside in warmer weather. It was also easy to put together which is a major plus! As a child development professional, I'd also recommend this for building gross motor skills. Definitely recommend this toy, we are so pleased with it...most importantly, so is our child! Alas, she has something she is allowed to climb on & it satisfies that natural interest for her, safely!"

2182,-1,Books_5,5,"Should fiction writers use Roget's Thesaurus? I've read and heard arguments on both sides. Those who say ""No"" think that writers using It write overblown prose, using a long word where a shorter one would be better.
I disagree. There are times when the first word that comes to mind is the easy word that does not get at the real meaning of a character's thought, or the feeling I want to convey. If I just write, ""the room was cold,"" I've shortchanged the reader. How cold and why does the temperature matter?  But if I show that people wear two pairs of thick wool socks just to sit inside, or get up three times in the night to make sure the baby's bed cap is on his head, or have another character remark that the mercury has frozen in the thermometer, the reader feels the cold.

For some reason wires just naturally find their way into nots, and having big heavy cable clamps on the ends doesn't help matters much.  Add to that the fact that your car won't start and your mood is deteriorating fast!  It's a recipe for disaster!  Well no longer!  Some finally invented something to save us from our frustrations.  The Arsenal cable organizer.

I bought a set of 25' Coleman 4ga Booster Cables with it and they fit without a problem!  So just about any jumper cable size and length combo should prove to work as well.  There are two sleve style compartments on the sides.  Good perhaps for a set of flat tools such as a wrench or plyers or good for gloves.  The stiching on the handles is top to bottom so I don't fear those coming loose.  The zippers are good heavy stock so they should last as well.

One more word of advice save the twist ties that come with your cables, and if they don't come with them get some.  Twist tying them before storage will help the bag keep them nice, neat, and flat.  And the bag will keep those monster clamps from hooking everything around them!

Update: I just bought a second bag and a set of Coleman 25' 2ga cables.  They fit great!  So buy this bag with confidence for just about any cable size and length combo you can find!!!"

2189,-1,Movies_and_TV_5,2,"I wasn't bothered by ""Extremely Dangerous'"" obvious borrowing of a central premise from ""The Fugitive."" It was the lack of suspense and surprises that got to me. I expected a thrill ride of a movie, but it never materialized over the long 3-hour 20-minute DVD.

Obviously, the script is the greatest weakness here. In terms of suspense or mystery, it is a total flop. None of the clues amount to much, you can see the supposed plot twists a mile away, and the villains are easy to spot.

The worst part was how the scriptwriter got the protagonist out of scrapes -- much like an old-time serial, there is even a scene where he dives into the water and is surrounded, seemingly without escape. Then, fade out. Fade in to Sean Bean back at his apartment. How he managed to escape is never shown or explained!

What I assume was the lack of much of a budget seems evident by other odd choices. In one scene, a skyscraper is said to be burning to the ground, but instead of seeing any part of it, we're told about it (with the sound effect of sirens in the background). A low budget is not always a liability, if it spurs creativity, which was not the case here.

What might have made this bearable -- an interesting main performance -- is not forthcoming from Bean. He exhibits no range or subtlety. That leaves the interesting bits to supporting actors -- in particular, Nitin Ganatra as a Pakistani cab service operator. His scenes crackle, but little else in the movie does."

I will say that the first novella in the book is a very strong, intriguing start.  The second novella describes an alien society.  It is probably a bit perplexing on the first read through, but it is still an entertaining read and you will at least get the overall picture.

I'd recommend this book to any serious science fiction reader, or any serious reader who likes science fiction occasionally.  If you don't like science fiction, you might have a knee jerk reaction to the book just because of its genre.

If you have to go all the way around you desk/table to lock you computer, this is not the best option."
2239,-1,Books_5,5,"I've been waiting for the next book in the series. I'm not sure if I will read the other two.  The first book was good but the second one was great.I enjoyed this book.  It was a little slow for me.  I don't know how I would rate a book without a lot of detail.  I'll try to keep a low rating.  I just didn't care for it as much as I did the first book.  I'm not sure if I would recommend this book to everyone, but I'm not sure I would recommend it to a friend.  It's definitely not for everyone, but it's great.  I think I'll give it 3 stars.  If you like suspense and intrigue, this is a good read.  It has a good story, but I really didn't like the book.  I just didn't like the characters.  I just couldn't relate to the story.  I just didn't like how the main"

The actors were outstanding.  Great story and the story line was clear.

This is a great movie"
2241,-1,Toys_and_Games_5,4,"My four-year-old daughter loves Disney Junior, and while she'll watch Miles from Tomorrowland, it's never been one of her favorites. As a result, this Photon Flyer was our first Miles toy. My daughter apparently recognized the craft from the show and immediately began to play with it.

Although the Miles figure glows and the wings light up, it's actually pretty basic for a toy vehicle these days.  The wings fold back a little for ""surface mode,"" and the nose of the craft can slightly extend for ""hyper speed mode,"" but that's about it. On the one hand, it opens a door for fun and imagination, but I think my youngest was a bit disappointed that it didn't at least make sounds.

Of course, this Photon Flyer works best when combined with other Miles toys that we do not have. It fits into a sold-separately toy called the Stellosphere, which -- according to the box -- ""amps up"" this toy with sounds, more lights, and larger wings. So at the moment, our vehicle is not ""amped up,"" nor do we have accessories (none included) to store in the ship's cute cargo hold. Although my daughter creatively put some Lion Guard stuff in there and promptly added Lion Guard figures to her Miles missions. And finally, the box prominently shows the Merc figure (not included) who has his own custom seat and moon roof in the flyer.

All in all, if you have other Miles toys already, this Photon Flyer is a great addition to any collection. It works great with other figures, accessories, and the Stellosphere set. If, like us, it's all on its own in the Miles universe, you'll likely be encouraged by your child to expand your collection... Unless they want to enlist other friends, like the Lion Guard, in their space adventures."

2244,-1,Books_5,5,"This comprehensive and beautifully written book. The author has a good grasp on how to use the data. I read this book in the middle of the night, and it was great. The story was well told and the characters were strong. I would recommend this to everyone. I loved this book. I have read the entire series, and I loved it. I've also read all of the other books in the series."
2245,-1,Books_5,2,"For what I paid for this book, I'd say I didn't need to read it. It is so well written and I am glad I bought it. I'm a fan of this book and I look forward to reading it again. I love how this author gives us the perspective of a woman who was a failed singer and a successful artist and was pushed out of her own music career after she had sold her first album. The story of her life is very touching. I highly recommend this book."
2246,-1,Movies_and_TV_5,1,"In an attempt to construct a more believable story, I've decided to turn my attention to the historical background. This is the story of the first American soldiers who fought in the Pacific during World War II. The film's premise is that the American troops who died in the war were forced to return to their country to fight in the Pacific. They were forced to leave the Pacific because of the threat of Japanese attack on American soil. This is a well-developed story that uses historical facts to fill in the gaps."
2247,-1,Movies_and_TV_5,4,I won't say it was better than the original but it was an awesome remake that they updated perfectly. Almost exactly the same as the Schwarzenegger movie.
